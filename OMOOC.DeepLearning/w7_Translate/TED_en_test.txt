We could use sales, anything you like.
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,
when companies are innovating,
they scale beautifully.
And we've looked at 23,000 companies
in the United States, may I say.
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.
What is astonishing about companies
is that they scale sublinearly
like biology,
indicating that they're dominated,
not by super-linear
innovation and ideas;
they become dominated
by economies of scale.
In that interpretation,
by bureaucracy and administration,
and they do it beautifully, may I say.
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,
I could have predicted the size of Walmart.
If it has this sublinear scaling,
the theory says
we should have sigmoidal growth.
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.
That's what we like, hockey sticks.
But you notice, I've cheated,
because I've only gone up to '94.
Let's go up to 2008.
That red line is from the theory.
So if I'd have done this in 1994,
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.
And then this is repeated
across the entire spectrum of companies.
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.
They all start looking like hockey sticks,
they all bend over,
and they all die like you and me.
Thank you.

I have been teaching for a long time,
and in doing so
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
that I really wish more people would understand
about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother --
bottom left for you guys over here --
graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information
because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
and she needed to go there to get the information,
because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation:
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school
to get the information from the teacher,
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
and take it with him,
because that is how information was being transported
from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid,
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born,
and it was extraordinary,
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
The information was inside my house
and it was awesome.
This was different
than either generation had experienced before,
and it changed the way I interacted with information
even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
In the time that passes
between when I was a kid in high school
and when I started teaching,
we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going
as an educational tool,
I take off from Wisconsin
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,
where I had an opportunity to teach
in a lovely, small-town,
rural Kansas school district,
where I was teaching my favorite subject,
American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,
loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade:
not exactly all that enthusiastic
about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience
that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them,
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They produced fliers. They called offices.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
They produced an election forum booklet
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school
for an evening of conversation
about government and politics
and whether or not the streets were done well,
and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced --
looked at me and went,
Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.

She doesn't know what she's in for.
But I knew that the kids would show up,
and I believed it,
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids --
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,
was I had this really
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with
in a truly public school,
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,
which is the gentleman
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
The problem then becomes
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
and deal with the subject in a way
that is responsible and respectful,
and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
as an example of a gentleman
who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation
that when you ask kids to use their own voice
and ask them to speak for themselves,
what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is:
how do you plan to use your life
to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say
when you ask them and take the time to listen
is extraordinary.
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school,
but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily
to be part of a learning environment
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
and that really wanted to investigate
what was possible
when you are willing to let go
of some of the paradigms of the past,
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
when you've given the tool
to acquire information to students,
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea
of allowing kids to fail
as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape
with an infatuation
with the culture of one right answer
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
and I am here to share with you:
it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,
to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer
doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project,
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off
because of the issue of the idea of failure.
My students produced these info-graphics
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
of the info-graphics that existed
in a lot of mass media,
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
and produce one for themselves
of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it,
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth,
and they can write very, very well,
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one --
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
or whether or not it was what I could create.
It asked them to create for themselves,
and it allowed them to fail,
process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,
they will do better this time,
because learning
has to include an amount of failure,
because failure is instructional
in the process.
There are a million pictures
that I could click through here,
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --
of students learning,
of what learning can look like
in a landscape where we let go of the idea
that kids have to come to school to get the information,
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places,
to see things for themselves,
to actually experience the learning,
to play, to inquire.
This is one of my favorite photos,
because this was taken on Tuesday,
when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too,
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
The main point
is that, if we continue to look at education
as if it's about coming to school
to get the information
and not about experiential learning,
empowering student voice and embracing failure,
we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system
that does not value these qualities,
because we won't get there with a standardized test,
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better,
and it's time to do better.

I'm going to talk to you today about
hopefully converting fear into hope.
When we go to the physician today --
when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
there are words that we just don't want to hear.
There are words that we're truly afraid of.
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
heart failure, lung failure --
things that we know are debilitating diseases,
for which there's relatively little that can be done.
And what I want to lay out for you today is
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
why it's important,
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
if you think it already hasn't,
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
and what some of the hurdles are.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
I want to start with this slide,
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
This was an issue from 2002
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
that everybody can understand.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
to a clinically relevant timescale.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
with devices and drugs and the like --
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
So that at the end of the treatment,
you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --
very few good ideas are truly novel.
And this is just the same.
If you look back in history,
Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
was actually one of the first people
along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
And they published this book in 1937,
where they actually began to think about,
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
We've come a long way since then.
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
But before doing that, what I'd like to do
is share my depression about the health care system
and the need for this with you.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about
improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is
to take care of our diseases as we get older.
This is simply the wealth of a country
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,
the older the people are within it.
Why is this important?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30,
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
maybe a little bit of asthma.
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
now the average person is looking at diabetes,
early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --
things that are inherently more difficult to treat,
and much more expensive to treat.
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
How can you actually afford to treat patients
when the reality of getting old looks like this?
This is age versus cost of health care.
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
plotted over your lifetime.
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
And you can actually --

-- we won't get into that.

There are very few things, very few things that you can really do
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
and experience what I would call healthy aging.
I'd suggest there are four things,
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
All those things do is change who pays.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
You can prevent.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
and then treating the disease to cure the disease
instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
But eventually it stops working,
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
This is a newt re-growing its limb.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
I'll actually show you some more important features
about limb regeneration in a moment.
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine
is doing this in every organ system of the body,
for tissues and for organs themselves.
So today's reality is that if we get sick,
the message is we will treat your symptoms,
and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
I would pose to you that tomorrow --
and when tomorrow is we could debate,
but it's within the foreseeable future --
we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
There's a limb prosthetic up here,
similar actually one on the soldier
that's come back from Iraq.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
How can we do that?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
will re-grow that limb.
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
It's a natural process,
but it is lost as we age.
In a child, before the age of about six months,
if they lose their fingertip in an accident,
they'll re-grow their fingertip.
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
So to engage in that conversation with the body,
we need to speak the body's language.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
through which to converse with the body.
The first is cellular therapies.
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
using cells to do most of the work.
Therefore, if we can find the right cells
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials,
or extract materials from a natural environment,
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these,
and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --
about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
if you threw away all the cells,
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals
that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question,
if I take that material, which is a natural material
that usually induces healing in the small intestine,
and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
would it give a tissue-specific response,
or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
The picture I'm about to show you
is a compelling picture.

However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --
even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --
the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.

What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
This is the reality of diabetes.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
The treatment for this is amputation.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,
that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
that it didn't have before.
There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --
I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
The horse just has another nostril that's developed
because of a riding accident.
Just a few weeks after treatment --
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --
and the horse heals up.
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world
who have used that material to heal their wounds.
Could you regenerate a limb?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
to begin the process of asking that question.
And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
After treatment that's what it looks like.
This is happening today.
This is clinically relevant today.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
But could you go a little further?
Could you, say, instead of using material,
can I take some cells along with the material,
and remove a damaged piece of tissue,
put a bio-degradable material on there?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties
and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's the coolest stuff.
Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
And what I'm going to show you here
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
And if you look really carefully,
it's going to be right around this point
you'll actually see a back-flush.
You see the cells coming back out.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
This was a randomized trial.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
These are now two years out.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,
with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
There go the cells.
We don't have time to go into all of those details,
but basically, that works too.
You can take patients who are less sick,
and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
through that kind of therapy.
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,
but I think very soon will be.
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
along with a number of colleagues around the world.
They've decided that liposuction fluid,
which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.

It's a great source of stem cells.
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
Out comes the liposuction fluid,
and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
All done in the lab.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
I talked before about the use of devices
to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
Here's just one example before I close up.
This is equally tragic.
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership
with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
Many of those patients are very severely burned.
And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,
it's that we don't know how to treat it.
Everything that is done to treat burn --
basically we do a sodding approach.
We make something over here,
and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --
it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --
by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
The gun that you see there sprays cells.
That's going to spray cells over that area.
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,
deliver other things as well at the same time,
and therefore we will seed that lawn,
as opposed to try the sodding approach.
It's a completely different way of doing it.
So my 18 minutes is up.
So let me finish up with some good news,
and maybe a little bit of bad news.
The good news is that this is happening today.
It's very powerful work.
Clearly the images kind of get that across.
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
is involved in trying to get this to happen.
A number of governments, and a number of regions,
have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
The Japanese government were perhaps the first,
when they decided to invest first 3 billion,
later another 2 billion in this field.
It's no coincidence.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The European Union, same thing.
China, the same thing.
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.

Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
We've had a different approach.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
But there's been no strategic investment
to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
just a few months ago,
to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
at which these things get to patients.
And at the end of a very testy meeting,
what the NIH director said was,
Your vision is larger than our appetite.
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,
but together we can change his appetite.
Thank you.
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,
I thought to myself that well, it's TED.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough
to justify my participation in something like that?
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent
might help things a bit.
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself
and just talk the way I really talk
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English
because I am from Queens, New York.

But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
I suppose it's fair to say
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
But then what?
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
And well, they're very excited.
What I should tell you --
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.

Okay. Okay. Oh, well.
Oh, wonderful.
Good evening everybody.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.
Oh my! There's so many of you.
Hi sweetheart. Okay.

Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Well you know, she calls herself black --
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
But anyway.

She has me here because she puts me in her show,
what she calls her one-woman show.
And you know what that means, of course.
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
But I don't mind.
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Really, it's amazing.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
but the celebrities.
There are so many celebrities running around here.
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Isn't that adorable?

So many others you see, they're just wonderful.
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
Did you know that about her?
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. 
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
Yeah, she's lovely.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --
you're all so young.
You know, your parents must be very proud.
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
It's like a rainbow.
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
But anyway, you know,
I just think that to be here with all of you
accomplished young people --
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
You know, it's heartening to me.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,
absolutely horrifying.
It's true. It's true.
You know, between the environmental degradation
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
Anyway.

The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas
to get us out of this mess.
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
Thank you for all that you do.
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.
So, happy continued success.
Congratulations. Mazel tov.

Hi. Hi.
Thank you everybody.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just --
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference
that you're doing and everything like that.
I am Dominican-American.
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
And I think he's Mexican, so that's --
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --

I just -- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,
as you can imagine.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
that this even exists.
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
I like that.
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,
which is like a leadership thing,
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
And the organization is called DA BOMB,
A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --
Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,
but with the war on terror and everything,
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB
and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.
So, basically like DA BOMB --
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.
Right now it's very exciting actually for me
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --
that's my new title.
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,
like something like this is so vital
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.
So, I think all people, we need that,
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,
making the talks available online.
That's very good. I love that.
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED
as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
Thank you very much.


So, that was Noraida,
and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
friends, neighbors, family members.
I come from a multicultural family.
In fact, the older lady you just met:
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
It's a long story, believe me.
But on top of my family background,
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,
where I encountered a plethora of new characters,
including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,
you know, she was kind of typically French.
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. 
But [German].
Yes, I took German for three years, [German],
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,
even in the UN school.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
Never. He always, always treated each of us,
you know, equally unbearably during the class.
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,
classmates from everywhere,
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
And they've inspired many characters as well.
For example, a friend of mine.
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
But, you know, I am originally from India,
and I wanted to start by telling you
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity
to come here to TED in California,
originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,
trying to make me feel comfortable
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. 
So, you can just imagine -- right.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.

And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --
I'm trying to behave myself,
it's my first time here.
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,
if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
Uh, well, thank you.
Good evening.
My name is Pauline Ning,
and first I want to tell you that I'm --
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,
much less like this
because I did not like to give speeches
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
I try anyway.

My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
But my background --
I want to tell you story only briefly.
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,
and they would always answer me back in English.
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
But when they got older,
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
But that's where we had some problems.
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
But first, she said she's not interested.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys
because I don't like them."

And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --
 --
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.

So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,
but from my son, not my daughter.

But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
So, even though sometimes it's still hard,
I will share with you that it helps me to realize
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,
because of ideas like this,
and people like you, with an open mind.
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives
in the ways maybe even you don't realize.
So, for my daughter's sake,
I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
Thank you. Xie xie.

Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her
to be last today.
I am originally from Jordan.
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
It is not Harvard.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But I am very proud of my students.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,
I do like to make the point that we in global society,
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
So, back in the ancient times.
[Arabic]
And this roughly translates:
Please, let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life
listening to the Beatles.
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Okay? Great.

Thank you all very much. It was lovely.
Thank you for having me.

Thank you very, very much. I love you.

Well, you have to let me say this.
I just -- thank you.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
And I know I've performed for some of your companies
or some of you have seen me elsewhere,
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

Just to put everything in context,
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,
and the things I'm going to do --
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
And by the time I was an intern house officer,
I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --
and I was a paid doctor.
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,
are now, as they say, in diaspora.
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,
where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not --
because that is not my vision.
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,
and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,
the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave
not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap
between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
Very interesting.
How many people do you think are on that taxi?
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,
that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police
that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,
and I didn't have a helmet, either.
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us
on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,
You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country.
And she's right. Every time you go there,
you know that if you actually need critical care --
critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --
of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --
where do they go?
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,
I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,
or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --
this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
You remember all that oil?
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but
I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can say some of this is education.
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,
malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated
in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
In fact, when I start running around saying,
Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,
can you come home with me and do a mission?"
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.
And that's my specialty, right?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
And believe me, these are current pictures.
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,
that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave
about intensive care units in Nigeria,
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
So, these are the problems.
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
I think we all know. And several speakers before
and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?
There we go -- we're going on a mission.
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,
on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,
cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid
and I do believe in charity. They have their place,
but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
Does he look like he's happy?
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,
you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,
Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,
you can't do this, I just know it."
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?

I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
We get a lot of donated equipment.
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,
or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,
so long as we use it and we move on.
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
So what we going to do now?
It looks like all these Americans are here and
yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --
he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,
I just thought about that.
We eventually got it working, is the truth,
but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,
it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,
you email them. But we were still using X-rays,
but we didn't even have a viewing box!
And we were doing open-heart surgery.
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,
but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --
this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,
VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
You still get people who believe in it and they came.
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,
would have been treated when she was a child.
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
We've done three. We're planning another one in July
in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,
but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --
we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
But how many did we do the first one? 12.
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,
and just watch that chair, all right?
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
Have you seen one of those before?
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --

-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."

Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,
gives them the tools they need to keep going."
And that's a perfect example of one.
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,
you buy a different one for children,
you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,
and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,
because we make it our duty to find out
what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,
does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:
multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,
that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
And guess what, if it all fails,
if you can find a car that's still got a live battery
and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,
and what we will have in a few months, I hope,
is that ability to use this same renewable energy system
to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --
zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.
This is what makes it so special.
Apart from the awards it's won,
it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --
and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent
of the FDA in the U.S.
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,
size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
This picture was taken last year.
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,
for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
There are too many of us outside and everybody,
just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --
if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,
it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions
that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,
looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
You have to do it. Africans have to do it,
in conjunction with everyone else.
Thank you.

I've actually been waiting by the phone
for a call from TED for years.
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
In 2004, I started Participant Productions
and we had a really good first year, and no call.
And finally, I get a call last year,
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.

You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.

When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,
I had some misgivings.
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.

And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.

Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
Hollywood gathers around power tables,
and the Valley gathers around power tables.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common
than I would have dreamed.
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And what really drives me is a vision of the future
that I think we all share.
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
And when we heard a lot of the presentations
over the last couple of days,
Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,
I think we all realized how far we have to go
to get to this new version of humanity
that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
And it's also something that resides in each of us,
to close what I think
are the two big calamities in the world today.
One is the gap in opportunity --
this gap that President Clinton last night
called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
and all these evils that we see around us.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
And I think that's just a horrible thing.
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
because within each of us is the power to
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
And if the men and women of TED
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
And so I used to read authors like James Michener
and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
And their stories made the world seem a very small
and interconnected place.
And it struck me that if I could write stories
that were about this world as being small and interconnected,
that maybe I could get people interested in the issues
that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
And my dad came home one day
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,
that one never knows how much time one really has.
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
I started a couple of businesses
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
One of those businesses was a computer rental business
called Micros on the Move,
which is very well named,
because people kept stealing the computers.

So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
with this idea to help people
buy and sell things online with each other.
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,
I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."

And needless to say, I was right.

But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
The company went public two years later
and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
But for me, personally, it was a real change.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
and living off their leftovers,
to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I wanted to figure out how I could
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
And around that time, I met John Gardner,
who is a remarkable man.
He was the architect of the Great Society programs
under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
or anyone could do, to make a difference
in the long-term issues facing humanity.
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
Bet on good people doing good things."
And that really resonated with me.
I started a foundation
to bet on these good people doing good things.
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,
who are using business skills in a very leveraged way
to solve social problems.
People today we call social entrepreneurs.
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
who started the Grameen Bank,
has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
won the Nobel Peace Prize.
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
because she felt girls' education was lagging.
And she started it about 10 years ago,
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,
who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
also known as black fever.
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And so this is one way to bet
on good people doing good things.
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change
that I find really is powerful.
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,
or in business. Invest in these folks.
Connecting them together through conferences --
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
that my foundation does at Oxford every year.
And celebrate them: tell their stories,
because not only are there good people doing good work,
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved
in the issues that affect us all.
And a light bulb went off,
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And I thought about the films that inspired me,
films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
And there really wasn't a specific company
that was focused on the public interest.
So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
One of the lines of encouragement
that I heard over and over was,
The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."
And then of course, there was the other adage.
The surest way to become a millionaire
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."

Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions
with the vision to be a global media company
focused on the public interest.
And our mission is to produce entertainment
that creates and inspires social change.
And we don't just want people to see our movies
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
Murder Ball, "North Country," "Syriana"
and "Good Night and Good Luck."
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
Perhaps more importantly,
tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
and the activism programs
that we created to go around the movies.
And we had an online component of that,
our community sect called Participate.net.
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually
kind of a box office disaster.
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,
domestic violence and so on.
And we released the film at the same time that
the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,
and with our social sector partners,
like the National Organization of Women,
the film was widely credited
with influencing the successful renewal of the act.
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --
the film started about a true-life story
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
And then the movie about this person doing these things,
then led to this greater renewal.
And so again,
it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --
I first saw Al do his slide show presentation
on global warming in May of 2005.
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
And after we saw his slide show,
it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
and Davis Guggenheim,
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
because we felt that we could get the message out there
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,
that nobody knows nothing about anything.
And I really thought this was going to be
a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
And so it was a great shock to all of us
when the film really captured the public interest,
and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
and most of Scandinavia.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.

And for Participant, this is just the start.
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
And we have 10 films in production right now,
and dozens others in development.
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
And we think once people see these films,
they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
and the Middle East in general.
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
Abby Hoffman and crew,
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals
who did make change in the world.
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --

#NAME?
In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity
to make change in their own way.
And all the people in this room
have done so through their business lives,
or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
And one thing that I've learned
is that there's never one right way to make change.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
but every one of us is all of those things and more.
And I believe if we do these things,
we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
And I can imagine, if we do this,
the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,
U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil --

-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate
10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."

And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."

And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
And I believe that, working together,
we can make all of these things happen.
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.
It's been a real honor. Thank you.

Oh, thank you.
I'm going to share with you the story
as to how I have become
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
In November of 2003,
I was invited to take part
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's
46664 Foundation --
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
And 46664 is the number
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited
to join Mandela in Robben Island,
where he was going to give a conference
to the world's press,
standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time,
Mandela told the world's press
that there was a virtual genocide
taking place in his country;
that post-apartheid
Rainbow Nation,
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis
and that the front line victims,
the most vulnerable of all,
were women and children.
This was a huge impact on my mind,
because I am a woman and I am a mother,
and I hadn't realized
that the HIV/AIDS pandemic
was directly affecting women in such a way.
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,
when I left Capetown,
I told myself, "This is going to be something
that I have to talk about.
I have to serve."
And so, subsequently
I participated in every single
46664 event
that I could take part in
and gave news conferences,
interviews,
talking and using my platform as a musician,
with my commitment to Mandela --
out of respect for the tremendous,
unbelievable work that he had done.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
But do they all know
about what has been taking place in South Africa,
his country,
the country that had one of the highest incidents
of transmission of the virus?
I think that if I went out into the street now
and I told people what was happening there,
they would be shocked.
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later
to have met Zackie Achmat,
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,
an incredible campaigner and activist.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool --
this tells you I am in solidarity
with people who have HIV,
people who are living with HIV.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
It doesn't have to be in the closet."
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
and I'm very proud to be a member
of that incredible organization.
It's a grassroots campaign
with 80 percent membership being women,
most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have tremendous outreach
to the people who are living directly
with the effects of the virus.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And yes, my SING Campaign
has supported Treatment Action Campaign
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness
and to try to also raise funds.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign
and the incredible work that they do,
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
So this is my SING Campaign.
SING Campaign is basically just me
and about three or four wonderful people
who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world
in the last two and a half years --
I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,
getting a nice, fat check;
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience
who ended up in tears
because I use film clips
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,
that people are tending to avoid,
because they are fatigued,
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,
attended that concert
and I had an opportunity to meet with him,
and he gave his absolute commitment
to try to making a change,
which is absolutely necessary.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I've subsequently become an envoy
for Scotland and HIV.
And I was showing them my experiences
and trying to, again, raise awareness.
And once again, in Edinburgh
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned
because of their family being affected
by the AIDS virus.
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --
he's the director of UNAIDS.
And I'm very honored
by the fact that Michel invited me,
only a few months ago,
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform
and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS
are currently sending out to the world
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination
of the transmission of the virus
from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
This can happen.
And here I am with a pregnant woman,
who is HIV positive
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,
because we know that that young woman
is receiving treatment
so her life can be extended
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
And her baby will receive PMTCT,
which will mean that that baby
can be born free of the virus.
Now that is prevention
at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention
with the AIDS pandemic.
Now, I just would like to finish off
to tell you the little story
about Avelile.
This is Avelile --
she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone
because she represents
one of millions
of HIV/AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother
had HIV virus --
she died
from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus,
she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old,
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life,
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS
and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet
and took great care of her.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter
and left us feeling very resonant
with this direct experience, this one child,
you know, that story.
Five months later,
we went back to South Africa
to meet Avelile again.
And I'm getting --
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
This is the transformation that took place.
Isn't it extraordinary?

That round of applause is actually
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you,
each one in the audience,
if you feel that every mother
and every child in the world
has the right to have access
to good nutrition and good medical care,
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,
specifically five and six,
should be absolutely committed to
by all governments around the world --
especially in sub-Saharan Africa --
could you please stand up.
I think that's fair to say,
it's almost everyone in the hall.
Thank you very much.

So I begin with an advertisement
inspired by George Orwell
that Apple ran in 1984.
 Big Brother: We are one people
with one will, one resolve,
one cause.
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,
and we will fight them with their own confusion.
We shall prevail.
Narrator: On January 24th,
Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984
won't be like "1984."
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video
remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies
will set us all free.
Fast-forward more than two decades:
Apple launches the iPhone in China
and censors the Dalai Lama out
along with several other politically sensitive applications
at the request of the Chinese government
for its Chinese app store.
The American political cartoonist
Mark Fiore
also had his satire application
censored in the United States
because some of Apple's staff
were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
His app wasn't reinstated
until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,
had its app censored
because the Apple nannies deemed it
to be a little bit too racy for their users,
and despite the fact that this magazine
is perfectly legal for sale
on newsstands throughout Germany.
And more controversially, recently,
Apple censored a Palestinian protest app
after the Israeli government voiced concerns
that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
So here's the thing.
We have a situation where private companies
are applying censorship standards
that are often quite arbitrary
and generally more narrow
than the free speech constitutional standards
that we have in democracies.
Or they're responding to censorship requests
by authoritarian regimes
that do not reflect consent of the governed.
Or they're responding to requests and concerns
by governments that have no jurisdiction
over many, or most, of the users and viewers
who are interacting with the content in question.
So here's the situation.
In a pre-Internet world,
sovereignty over our physical freedoms,
or lack thereof,
was controlled almost entirely
by nation-states.
But now we have this new layer
of private sovereignty
in cyberspace.
And their decisions about software coding,
engineering, design, terms of service
all act as a kind of law
that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
And their sovereignties,
cross-cutting, globally interlinked,
can in some ways
challenge the sovereignties of nation-states
in very exciting ways,
but sometimes also act
to project and extend it
at a time when control
over what people can and cannot do
with information
has more effect than ever
on the exercise of power
in our physical world.
After all, even the leader of the free world
needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan
if he wants to get reelected next year.
And these platforms
were certainly very helpful
to activists in Tunisia and Egypt
this past spring and beyond.
As Wael Ghonim,
the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,
secret-Facebook-activist by night,
famously said to CNN
after Mubarak stepped down,
If you want to liberate a society,
just give them the Internet."
But overthrowing a government is one thing
and building a stable democracy
is a bit more complicated.
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist
who was part of the storming
of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
And many of the agents
shredded as many of the documents as they could
and left them behind in piles.
But some of the files were left behind intact,
and activists, some of them,
found their own surveillance dossiers
full of transcripts of their email exchanges,
their cellphone text message exchanges,
even Skype conversations.
And one activist actually found
a contract from a Western company
for the sale of surveillance technology
to the Egyptian security forces.
And Egyptian activists are assuming
that these technologies for surveillance
are still being used
by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --
not nearly as extensively
as under President Ben Ali.
But you'll see here a blocked page
of what happens when you try to reach
certain Facebook pages and some other websites
that the transitional authorities
have determined might incite violence.
In protest over this,
blogger Slim Amamou,
who had been jailed under Ben Ali
and then became part of the transitional government
after the revolution,
he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia
about how to handle this kind of problem.
In fact, on Twitter,
there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution
who said, "Well actually,
we do want democracy and free expression,
but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds
because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
But the problem is,
how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions
and how do you make sure
that they do not abuse their power?
As Riadh Guerfali,
the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,
remarked over this incident,
Before, things were simple:
you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
Today, things are a lot more subtle."
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
The reality is
that even in democratic societies today,
we do not have good answers
for how you balance the need
for security and law enforcement on one hand
and protection of civil liberties
and free speech on the other
in our digital networks.
In fact, in the United States,
whatever you may think of Julian Assange,
even people who are not necessarily big fans of his
are very concerned about the way
in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer
after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,
despite the fact
that Wikileaks had not been charged,
let alone convicted,
of any crime.
So we assume
that the Internet is a border-busting technology.
This is a map of social networks worldwide,
and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --
which is either a good or a bad thing,
depending on how you like
the way Facebook manages its service.
But borders do persist
in some parts of cyberspace.
In Brazil and Japan,
it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
But if you look at China, Vietnam
and a number of the former Soviet states,
what's happening there is more troubling.
You have a situation
where the relationship between government
and local social networking companies
is creating a situation
where, effectively,
the empowering potential of these platforms
is being constrained
because of these relationships
between companies and government.
Now in China,
you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,
that blocks Facebook
and Twitter and now Google+
and many of the other overseas websites.
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
But that's only half of the story.
The other part of the story
are requirements that the Chinese government places
on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,
known as a system of self-discipline.
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance
of their users.
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009
where the Internet Society of China presented awards
to the top 20 Chinese companies
that are best at exercising self-discipline --
i.e. policing their content.
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,
China's dominant search engine,
was one of the recipients.
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet
and directly censor websites.
But this is a website called Rospil
that's an anti-corruption site.
And earlier this year,
there was a troubling incident
where people who had made donations to Rospil
through a payments processing system
called Yandex Money
suddenly received threatening phone calls
from members of a nationalist party
who had obtained details
about donors to Rospil
through members of the security services
who had somehow obtained this information
from people at Yandex Money.
This has a chilling effect
on people's ability to use the Internet
to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today
where in more and more countries
the relationship between citizens and governments
is mediated through the Internet,
which is comprised primarily
of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think,
is not this debate over whether the Internet
is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
Of course, it's going to empower
whoever is most skilled at using the technology
and best understands the Internet
in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
The most urgent question we need to be asking today
is how do we make sure
that the Internet evolves
in a citizen-centric manner.
Because I think all of you will agree
that the only legitimate purpose of government
is to serve citizens,
and I would argue
that the only legitimate purpose of technology
is to improve our lives,
not to manipulate or enslave us.
So the question is,
we know how to hold government accountable.
We don't necessarily always do it very well,
but we have a sense of what the models are,
politically and institutionally, to do that.
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace
accountable to the public interest
when most CEO's argue
that their main obligation
is to maximize shareholder profit?
And government regulation
often isn't helping all that much.
You have situations, for instance, in France
where president Sarkozy
tells the CEO's of Internet companies,
We're the only legitimate representatives
of the public interest."
But then he goes and champions laws
like the infamous "three-strikes" law
that would disconnect citizens from the Internet
for file sharing,
which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur
on Freedom of Expression
as being a disproportionate violation
of citizens' right to communications,
and has raised questions amongst civil society groups
about whether
some political representatives
are more interested in preserving
the interests of the entertainment industry
than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
And here in the United Kingdom
there's also concern over
a law called the Digital Economy Act
that's placing more onus
on private intermediaries
to police citizen behavior.
So what we need to recognize
is that if we want to have
a citizen-centric Internet in the future,
we need a broader and more sustained
Internet freedom movement.
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater
as a matter of course,
or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,
just because executives woke up one day
and decided it was the right thing to do.
It was the result of decades of sustained activism,
shareholder advocacy
and consumer advocacy.
Similarly, governments don't enact
intelligent environmental and labor laws
just because politicians wake up one day.
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged
political activism
that you get the right regulations,
and that you get the right corporate behavior.
We need to make the same approach
with the Internet.
We also are going to need
political innovation.
Eight hundred years ago, approximately,
the barons of England decided
that the Divine Right of Kings
was no longer working for them so well,
and they forced King John
to sign the Magna Carta,
which recognized
that even the king
who claimed to have divine rule
still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
This set off a cycle
of what we can call political innovation,
which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --
which was implemented for the first time
by that radical revolutionary government
in America across the pond.
So now we need to figure out
how to build consent of the networked.
And what does that look like?
At the moment, we still don't know.
But it's going to require innovation
that's not only going to need
to focus on politics,
on geopolitics,
but it's also going to need
to deal with questions
of business management, investor behavior,
consumer choice
and even software design and engineering.
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play
in building the kind of world
in which government and technology
serve the world's people and not the other way around.
Thank you very much.

These are grim economic times,
fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
And so, I would like to cheer you up
with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,
commercial success stories
of the past 20 years.
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,
to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession
with equanimity.
I refer to organized crime.
Now organized crime has been around
for a very long time, I hear you say,
and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades,
it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
now accounting for roughly 15 percent
of the world's GDP.
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,
or McMafia, for short.
So what triggered this extraordinary growth
in cross-border crime?
Well, of course, there is globalization,
technology, communications, all that stuff,
which we'll talk about a little bit later.
But first, I would like to take you back
to this event:
the collapse of communism.
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode
in our post-war history.
Now it's time for full disclosure.
This event meant a great deal to me personally.
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain
to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,
like Solidarity in Poland,
when I was in my teens.
I then started writing about Eastern Europe,
and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,
which is what I was doing in 1989.
And so when 425 million people
finally won the right
to choose their own governments,
I was ecstatic,
but I was also a touch worried
about some of the nastier things
lurking behind the wall.
It wasn't long, for example,
before ethnic nationalism
reared its bloody head
in Yugoslavia.
And amongst the chaos,
amidst the euphoria,
it took me a little while to understand
that some of the people who had wielded power
before 1989, in Eastern Europe,
continued to do so after the revolutions there.
Obviously there were characters like this.
But there were also some more unexpected people
who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
Like this character. Remember these guys?
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting
and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
and they were the great celebrities of communism,
with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
They used to get great apartments in the center of town,
casual sex on tap,
and they could travel to the West very freely,
which was a great luxury at the time.
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
in the emergence of the market economy
in Eastern Europe.
Or as I like to call them, they are
the midwives of capitalism.
Here are some of those same weightlifters
after their 1989 makeover.
Now in Bulgaria --
this photograph was taken in Bulgaria --
when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,
it wasn't just communism;
it was the state that collapsed as well.
That means your police force wasn't working.
The court system wasn't functioning properly.
So what was a business man in the brave new world
of East European capitalism going to do
to make sure that his contracts would be honored?
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically
by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
We prefer to know them as the mafia.
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined
with 14,000 people
who were sacked from their jobs in the security services
between 1989 and 1991.
Now, when your state is collapsing,
your economy is heading south at a rate of knots,
the last people you want coming on to the labor market
are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills
are surveillance,
are smuggling, building underground networks
and killing people.
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
Now, when I was working in the 1990s,
I spent most of the time covering
the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
And I couldn't help notice
that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,
the paramilitary organizations,
were actually the same people running
the organized criminal syndicates.
And I came to think that behind the violence
lay a sinister criminal enterprise.
And so I resolved to travel around the world
examining this global criminal underworld
by talking to policemen,
by talking to victims, by talking to consumers
of illicit goods and services.
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.
Why? Well of course
there was the issue of law and order collapsing,
but also, as they say in the retail trade,
it's location, location, location.
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research
that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone
for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
Heroin, cocaine,
women being trafficked into prostitution
and precious minerals.
And where were they heading?
The European Union, which by now
was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,
transforming it into
the most affluent consumer market in history,
eventually comprising some 500 million people.
And a significant minority
of those 500 million people
like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash
sleeping with prostitutes,
sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose
and employing illegal migrant laborers.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world
operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production,
like Afghanistan and Columbia.
It has zones of distribution,
like Mexico and the Balkans.
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption,
like the European Union, Japan
and of course, the United States.
The zones of production and distribution
tend to lie in the developing world,
and they are often threatened by appalling violence
and bloodshed.
Take Mexico, for example.
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months
as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
Since 1998, five million people have died there.
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,
but it's the biggest conflict on this planet
since the Second World War.
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world
cooperate with local paramilitaries
in order to seize the supplies
of the rich mineral resources
of the region.
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan
was sourced to the killing fields
of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,
in almost every laptop
and games console.
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia
in exchange for weapons,
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
And it is this Western desire
to consume
that is the primary driver
of international organized crime.
Now, let me show you some of my friends in action,
caught conveniently on film by the Italian police,
and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,
there are very handsome profits to be made,
and I want to show you this to demonstrate
the type of resources available to these groups.
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.
From 1994, for seven years,
20 of these boats
made the trip across the Adriatic,
from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
And as a consequence of this trade,
Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia
and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
Now Italian police, when this trade started,
had just two boats which could go at the same speed.
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys
is if they run out of gas.
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them
women being trafficked into prostitution,
and if the police intervened, they would hurl
the women into the sea
so that the police had to go and save them from drowning,
rather than chasing the bad guys.
So I have shown you this to demonstrate
how many boats, how many vessels it takes
to catch one of these guys.
And the answer is six vessels.
And remember, 20 of these speed boats
were coming across the Adriatic
every single night.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
Well, this is where we come to globalization,
because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.
And boy, did that make it easy
for the money launderers.
The last two decades have been the champagne era
for dirty lucre.
In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world
competing for their business,
and there was simply no effective mechanism
to prevent money laundering.
And a lot of licit banks were also happy
to accept deposits
from very dubious sources
without questions being asked.
But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.
Now these things
are an essential part of the money laundering parade,
and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion
and transnational organized crime, money laundering,
you have to get rid of them.
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House
who has consistently spoken out
against these corrosive entities.
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe
is the necessity for
new legislation, regulation, effective regulation,
I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,
who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters
with the Colombian cartels
and the major Russian crime syndicates,
but he did this for decades
in the very heart of Wall Street,
and no regulator picked up on it.
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street
or in the city of London,
fleecing ordinary folk
and money laundering?
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
This one, however, is in central British Columbia
where I photographed it.
It's one of the tens of thousands
of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
which ensure that over five percent
of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver
to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated
by the RCMP
from the smugglers who are sending it,
of course, down south to the United States
where there is an insatiable market
for B.C. Bud, as it's called,
in part because it's marketed as organic,
which of course goes down very well in California.


Now, even by the police's admission,
this makes not a dent in the profits, really,
of the major exporters.
Since the beginning of globalization,
the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
There has, however, been no concomitant increase
in the resources available
to police forces.
This, however, may all be about to change,
because something very strange is going on.
The United Nations recognized
earlier this -- it was last month actually --
that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production
of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
Interestingly, the market share
of heroin and cocaine is going down,
because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
Now that is a game changer,
because it shifts production away from the developing world
and into the Western world.
When that happens, it is a trend
which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years
is long overdue for a very serious rethink,
in my opinion.
Now, the recession.
Well, organized crime has already adapted
very well to the recession.
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry
in the whole world.
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.
Except, of course, it has two business risks:
arrest by law enforcement,
which is, frankly, the least of their worries,
and competition from other groups,
i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
What they've done is they've shifted their operations.
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently
during a recession.
And so instead, they have invaded financial
and corporate crime in a big way,
but above all, two sectors,
and that is counterfeit goods
and cybercrime.
And it's been terribly successful.
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Se?or Pringle.
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista
in S?o Paulo, together.
Hooked it up to my laptop,
and within about five minutes he had penetrated
the computer security system
of a major Brazilian bank.
It's really not that difficult.
And it's actually much easier because
the fascinating thing about cybercrime
is that it's not so much the technology.
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.
Or to use the technical term for it,
there's one born every minute.
You would not believe how easy it is
to persuade people to do things with their computers
which are objectively not in their interest.
And it was very soon
when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,
of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet
is through the promise of sex and love.
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,
one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,
because the first person I received it from
was an ex-girlfriend of mine.
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,
but love was not amongst them.

And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,
I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin
and spared myself a very nasty infection.
So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing
is the Internet is assisting these guys.
These are mosquitoes who carry the malarial parasite
which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal
at our expense.
Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug
at destroying the parasite in the early days
of infection.
But over the past year or so,
researchers in Cambodia have discovered
that what's happening is
the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance
is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,
and so they buy it from the Internet.
And these pills contain only low doses
of the active ingredient.
Which is why
the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
The reason I say this
is because we have to know
that organized crime
impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes
or take drugs
in order to have a relationship with organized crime.
They affect our bank accounts.
They affect our communications, our pension funds.
They even affect the food that we eat
and our governments.
This is no longer an issue
of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
There is no romance involved with gangsters
in the 21st Century.
This is a mighty industry,
and it creates instability and violence
wherever it goes.
It is a major economic force
and we need to take it very, very seriously.
It's been a privilege talking to you.
Thank you very much.

You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
because I felt like I wasn't going to be able
to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
It's such a large conference.
But he explained to me that he was in a bind,
and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal
and star power that the conference was known for --

so I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris. I'll come on two conditions.
One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006.
And luckily he agreed. And the theme, in two years,
is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."


I invented the Placebo Camera.

It doesn't actually take pictures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper,
and you still feel like you were there.

Dear Sir, Good day, compliments of the day, and my best wishes
to you and family. I know this letter will come to you surprisingly,
but let it not be a surprise to you,
for nature has a way of arriving unannounced,
and, as an adage says, originals are very hard to find,
but their echoes sound louder. So I decided to contact you myself,
for you to assure me of safety and honesty,
if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
I am Mister Michael Bangoora, the son of late Mister Tiamu Bangoora --

who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone --

but was killed during a civil war.

Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment,
and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business,
on which premise I write you.

Before my father death,
he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars,
which he kept away from the rebel leaders
during the course of the war.

This fund was supposed to be used
for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country,
before the outbreak of war. When the war broke out,
the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him,
my father insisted it was not in his possession,
and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
Meanwhile, my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund
because my father always confide in me.
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker,
who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,
although he did not know the real contents of the box.

The fund was deposited as a family reassure,
in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,
where I was only given temporary asylum.
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal
due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me,
are the following: one, be a silent partner
and receive the funds in your account in trust;
two, provide a bank account under your control
to which the funds will be remitted;
three, receive the funds into your account in trust;
take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money
until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
Sincerely, Mister Michael Bangoora."


This is really embarrassing.
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes.
I only prepared 15.

So if it's cool, I'd like to just wait for three.

I'm really sorry.


What's your name?

Mark Serfaas. It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.

Are you a virgin? Virgin?

I mean -- no, I mean like in the TED sense?

Are you? Oh, yeah. So what are you,
like, a thousand, two thousand, somewhere in there? Huh? Oh?
You don't know what I'm talking about?

Ah, Mark --

Serfaas.

1,860 -- am I good?

And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

Yeah, I was hanging out with some Google guys last night.
Really cool, we were getting wasted.

And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced
that, based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime,
they can actually predict what you are going to say next.

And I was like, "Get the fuck out of here. That's crazy."

But they said, "No, but don't show anyone," but they slipped up.
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
and my name, and it would tell me. And I have to tell you, right now,
this is an unadulterated piece of software,
this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site,
and we're going to test it out live today.
What was I going to say next? And "Ze Frank" -- that's me.
Am I feeling lucky?

Am I feeling lucky?
Audience: Yes.

Ze Frank: Oh. Amazing.

In March of 2001 --

I filmed myself dancing to Madonna's "Justify My Love."
On a Thursday, I sent out a link to a website
that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends,
as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th --
th -- 26th birthday party.

By Monday, over a million people
were coming to this site a day.

Within a week, I received a call from Earthlink that said,
due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge,
I owed them 30,000 dollars.

Needless to say, I was able to leave my job.

And, finally, you know, become freelance.

But some people refer to me more of -- as, like, an Internet guru or --

swami.

I -- I knew I had something.
I'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain
and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here,
because it's a little too deep for all of you, but --

it's about what makes websites popular, and, you know, it's --

it's unfortunate that I don't have more time.
Maybe I can come back next year, or something like that.

I'm obsessed with email. I get a lot of it.
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day
from people I don't know, and it's been an amazing opportunity
to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
You can kind of peer into other people's lives,
and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration
from the average user.
For example, somebody wrote me.
They said, "Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,
you should rock out with us," and I said, "Why wait?"
And they said, "Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,
but I meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked."

And that was embarrassing.
But you know, it's kind of a collaboration
between me and the fans, so I said, "Sure."

I hear a lot of you whispering.

And I know what you're saying. You're saying, "Holy crap,
how is his presentation so smooth?"

And I have to say that it's not all me this year.
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past,
I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED. I don't know.

And so, this year, Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator.

Which really allowed us as speakers to get there, in the trenches,
and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
And I gotta say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.

I'd like to tell all of you a little joke. Not just the good stuff, though.
You can do heckler mode.
Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage.
ZF: You get off the stage.

Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.


In case you run over time.
I'd -- just one last thing I'd like to say, I'd, really --

like to thank all of you for being here.

And frog mode.
 "Ah, the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ..."



It's true. Some people say to me,
they say, "Ze, you're doing all this stuff, this Internet stuff,
and you're not making any money.

Why? And I say, "Mom, Dad --

I'm trying. You know, I don't know if you're all aware of this,
but the video -- the video game market,
kids are playing these video games, oh,
but, supposedly, there's tons of money.
I mean, like, I think, 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent
on these things. So I decided to try my hand.
I came up with a few games.

This is called "Atheist."
I figured it'd be popular with the young kids.
Look, I'll move around and say some things.


So that didn't go over so well.

I don't really understand why you're laughing.

Should have done this before I tried to pitch it.
Buddhist, of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."

But you come back as a duck.

And this is great because, you know, for a quarter,
you can play this for a long time.

And Chris had said in an email that, you know,
we should really bring something new to TED,
something that we haven't shown anyone.
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."
It's the third in the series.
I'm hoping it's going to do well this year.

Do you have a preference? Good choice.

So you can wait for the Second Coming -- 
which is --

a random number between one and 500 million.

So really, what are we talking about here? Oh, tech joy.

Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
And in fact, making things using technology --
and I'm being serious here, even though I'm using my sarcastic voice --
I won't -- hold on. Making things, you know --
making things actually does give me a lot of joy.
It's the process of creation that keeps me sort of
a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,
and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project --
where you know you still have something to do,
but it's not finished, and you're not starting something --
that really fills my entire life.
And so, what I've done is, I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces to share that feeling
with people who don't consider themselves artists.
We're in a culture of guru-ship. It's so hard to use some software
because, you know, it's unapproachable,
people feel like they have to read the manual.
So I try to --

#NAME?
that allow people to express themselves, and, hopefully --
whoa, I'm like -- on the page, but it doesn't exist.

It's, like -- seriously, though --

I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves.

Here I created a contest called, "When Office Supplies Attack,"
which, I think, really resonated with the --

working population.

Over 500 entries in three weeks, toilet paper fashion.

Again, people from all over the country doing --
the watch is particularly incredible.

Online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them.
I think they're wonderful.
I think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons
and all that kind of stuff. But I'm interested in the process,
the process of creating, as the real event that I'm interested in.
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing,
and they get bummed out at this, sort of, you know, stick figure,
awful little thing that they created.
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
or draw, you know, they draw penises and things like that.

So, the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool.
In other words, it's a helping tool.
You can draw your simple stick figure, and then it collaborates
with you to create, sort of, like, a post-war German etching.

So you can -- in fact, it's tuned to be better at drawing things
that look worse. So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling, and --
so the idea is that you can really,
you know, partake in this process,
but watch something really crappy look beautiful.
And here are some of my favorites. This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me. Here we are, very cool.

Darling. Beautiful stuff.
I mean this is incredible. This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this
and submitted it. It's just gorgeous.

I'm -- I'm dead serious here. I'm actually -- this is not a joke.

But, I think, it's a -- it's a really fun and wonderful thing.
So this is called the "Fiction Project." This is an online space,
which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board
that encourages collaborative fiction writing.
These are haikus.
None of the haikus were written by the same person,
and in fact, no line was --
you know, each line is contributed by a different person
at a different -- at a different time.
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,
mistress cruel approaches me, now tied down, it's up."
It's -- it's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,
says, "Let's talk" -- that, like, chills you to the very core.
But it's peripheral activities, like these,
that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
They actually get to know each other,
and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key
to bringing up some of our bonding social capital
that we're lacking. And very, very quickly --
I love puppets. Here's a puppet.
It dances to music. Lotte Reiniger,
an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s,
that started doing more elaborate things.
I became interested in puppets,
and I just want to show one last thing to you.
Oh, this is how you make puppets.

Chris Anderson: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

Well, this is 2009.
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists
are anxious to celebrate this.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us
on almost every aspect
of Darwin and his life,
and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect,
because there is one aspect of this story
which they have thrown no light on.
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it
and to talk about something else.
So I'm going to talk about it.
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us
how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,
very, very closely related.
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,
there's a chimp, there's a man;
they're astoundingly different,
no resemblance at all.
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff
about culture or psychology, or behavior.
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,
measurable physical differences.
They, that one,
is hairy and walking on four legs.
That one is a naked biped. Why?
I mean --

if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe
there's a reason for that.
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
What happened?
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.
Everybody knew the answer.
They knew what happened.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
our ancestors went out onto the plain.
That explained everything.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
or to chase after animals,
or to free our hands for weapons.
And we got so overheated in the chase
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Everybody knew that, for generations.
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely
at the accompanying microfauna
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they weren't savanna species.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
fossilized pollen.
Shock, horror.
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.
Some of it even came from lianas,
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
So we're left with a situation where
we know that our earliest ancestors
were moving around on four legs in the trees,
before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
This is not something I've made up.
It's not a minority theory.
Everybody agrees with it.
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa
and spoke to University College London.
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,
forget about it. It was wrong.
We've got to go back to square one and start again."
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
You've believed it through generations.
Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
Well, we know the answer because
Thomas S. Kuhn
wrote a seminal treatise
about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do
when a paradigm fails
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.

If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong,
but supposing it was right ..."

And the only other option open to them
is to stop asking the questions.
So that is what they have done now.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.
It's what we ought to be doing.
Aaron Filler from Harvard said,
Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
And if you're going to say,
I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.
And the irony of it is,
that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse
where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.
There was one waiting in the wings.
It had been waiting there since 1960
when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,
said, "I think what happened,
perhaps our ancestors
had a more aquatic existence
for some of the time."
He kept it to himself for 30 years.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
You must never do that again."
And at that time, it became set in stone:
the aquatic theory should be dumped
with the UFOs and the yetis,
as part of the lunatic fringe of science.
Well I don't think that.
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
I'd like to talk about just a handful
of what have been called the
hallmarks of mankind,
the things that made us different from everybody else,
and all our relatives.
Let's look at our naked skin.
It's obvious that most of the things we think about
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,
the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,
could that be why we are naked?
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.
I mean, look at the elephant.
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
So back in 1982 I said,
Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
Peals of merry laughter!
That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms
have aquatic ancestors.
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros
and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,
because look at the sea otter.
But you can say
that every animal that has become naked
has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,
or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
And take bipedality.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
are capable of walking on two legs,
if they want to, for a short time.
There is only one circumstance in which they
always, all of them, walk on two legs,
and that is when they are wading through water.
Do you think that's significant?
David Attenborough thinks it's significant,
as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
Look at the fat layer.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Why should it be there?
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
the fat that in most land mammals
is deposited inside the body wall,
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
has started to migrate to the outside,
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
In the whale it's complete:
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
We cannot avoid the suspicion
that in our case it's started to happen.
We have got skin lined with this layer.
It's the only possible explanation of why humans,
if they're very unlucky,
can become grossly obese,
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
The question of why we can speak.
We can speak.
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath
are the diving animals and the diving birds.
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
Trying to imagine a diver
diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla
performing the same maneuver,
and you can see that, compared with gorilla,
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,
this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,
and it is not lunatic fringe.
And the ironic thing about it is that
they are not staving off the aquatic theory
to protect a theory of their own,
which they've all agreed on, and they love.
There is nothing there.
They are staving off the aquatic theory
to protect a vacuum.


How do they react when I say these things?
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times
is, "But it was investigated.
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,
when Hardy put forward his article."
I don't believe it.
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence
of any incident of that kind,
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
It's never been done.
I ask people sometimes, and they say,
I like the aquatic theory!
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"
They say "Well ...
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.

And if you've got a scientific problem like that,
you can't solve it by holding a head count,
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."

Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.
Some of them have come over.
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.
Anybody else out there? Come on in.
The water is lovely.

And now we've got to look to the future.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting.
That would be very sad.
The second thing that could happen
is that some young genius will arrive,
and say, "I've found it.
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
No sign of that happening either.
I don't think there is a third option.
So the third thing that might happen is
a very beautiful thing.
If you look back at the early years of the last century,
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling
between the believers in Mendel,
and the believers in Darwin.
It ended with a new synthesis:
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas
blending together.
And I think the same thing will happen here.
You'll get a new synthesis.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas
will be blended together.
And we can move forward from there,
and really get somewhere.
That would be a beautiful thing.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.

Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,
At my age, I don't even buy green bananas.

So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,
what's holding it up?
I can tell you that in three words.
Academia says no.
They decided in 1960,
That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis.
And it's not easy to change their minds.
The professional journals
won't touch it with a barge pole.
The textbooks don't mention it.
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,
let alone look for a reason to it.
Horizon, which takes its cue from the academics,
won't touch it with a barge pole.
So we never hear the case put for it,
except in jocular references
to people on the lunatic fringe.
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.
Somebody up there
is issuing the commandment,
Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
And if you hope to make progress in this profession,
and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,
because it will get in your way."
So I get the impression that some parts
of the scientific establishment
are morphing into a kind of priesthood.
But you know, that makes me feel good,
because Richard Dawkins has told us
how to treat a priesthood.

He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it
all the excessive awe and reverence
it's been trained to receive."
Right. I'll go ahead with that.
And secondly, he says,
You must never be afraid to rock the boat.
I'll go along with that too.
Thank you very much.

One of the things that
defines a TEDster
is you've taken your passion,
and you've turned it into stewardship.
You actually put action to the issues you care about.
But what you're going to find eventually is
you may need to actually get elected officials
to help you out.
So, how do you do that?
One of the things I should probably tell you is,
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,
and that sort of warped my framework.
So, when you start to think about politicians,
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,
and they have very strange breeding habits,
how do you actually work with these things? 
What we need to understand is:
What drives the political creature?
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
One is reputation and influence.
These are the primary tools by which
a politician can do his job.
The second one -- unlike most animals,
which is survival of the species --
this is preservation of self.
Now you may think it's money,
but that's actually sort of a proxy
to what I can do to preserve myself.
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
You can send them an email.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many
Viagra ads coming at me,
your email is lost.
It doesn't matter, it's spam.
How about you get on the phone?
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,
Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it.
That doesn't move.
Face to face would work,
but it's hard to set it up.
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference
and they set a context for having a conversation,
but it takes some time to build up.
So what actually works?
And the answer is rather strange.
It's a letter.
We live in a digital world,
but we're fairly analog creatures.
Letters actually work.
Even the top dog himself
takes time every day to read 10 letters
that are picked out by staff.
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with
will tell you about the letters they get
and what they mean.
So, how are you going to write your letter?
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time
getting your hand bent around it, 
but this is actually critical.
And it is critical that
you actually handwrite your letter.
It is so novel to see this,
that somebody actually picked up an analog device
and has written to me.
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that
you get into a proactive stance
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
Here's my promise to you:
If you are consistent and do this,
within three months the elected official will start calling you
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
Now, I'm going to give you
a four paragraph format to work with.
Now, when you approach these animals,
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,
and you also need to approach them
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
So in paragraph number one,
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:
You appreciate them.
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
So, here you go. 
Paragraph number two:
You may actually have to just get very blunt
and say what's really on your mind.
When you do this,
don't attack people;
you attack tactics.
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
Paragraph number three:
When animals are attacked or cornered,
they will fight to the death,
so you have to give them an exit.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
Obviously, you're intelligent.
If you had the right information,
you would have done the right thing." 
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
You're the safe place to come in to.
So, in paragraph number four,
you're going to tell people,
If no one is providing you with this information, let me help. 
Animals do displays. They do two things:
They warn you or they try to attract you
and say, "We need to mate."
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,
you volunteer, you do something else.
Why is is this important?
Because this establishes the two
primary criteria for the political creature:
that you have influence in a large sphere,
and that my preservation depends on you.
Here is one very quick hack,
especially for the feds in the audience.
Here's how you mail your letter.
First of all, you send the original to the district office.
So, you send the copy to the main office.
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler
and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
And you actually get into the folder
that the elected official actually has to read.
So, what your letter means:
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,
and political officials are the pinatas.

We are harangued, lectured to,
sold, marketed,
but a letter is actually one of the few times
that we have honest communication.
I got this letter when I was first elected,
and I still carry it to
every council meeting I go to.
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,
and if you have stewardship
and want to communicate,
that dialogue is incredibly powerful.
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
Get writing.

All buildings today have something in common.
They're made using Victorian technologies.
This involves blueprints,
industrial manufacturing
and construction using teams of workers.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy
from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities
is by connecting them to nature,
not insulating them from it.
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.
Living systems are in constant conversation
with the natural world,
through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances
into another, either through
the production or the absorption of energy.
And this is the way in which living materials
make the most of their local resources
in a sustainable way.
So, I'm interested in the use of
metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller
at the Bartlett School of Architecture,
and we're collaborating with international scientists
in order to generate these new materials
from a bottom up approach.
That means we're generating them from scratch.
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,
and he's really interested in the transition from
inert to living matter.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,
when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.
Now all this is -- and it's magic --
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself
in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions,
some of which are happily architectural.
So here we are. These are protocells,
patterning their environment.
We don't know how they do that yet.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere
and turn it into carbonate.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies
towards creating bottom-up construction approaches
for architecture,
which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods
which impose structure upon matter.
That can't be energetically sensible.
So, bottom-up materials
actually exist today.
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,
and have a look at the brickwork,
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
And if you look even closer,
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
Now a block of limestone, in itself,
isn't particularly that interesting.
It looks beautiful.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be
if the surfaces were actually
in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond
to dramatic changes
in the immediate environment.
So, architects are never happy
with just one block of an interesting material.
They think big. Okay?
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,
we can start thinking about ecological interventions
like repair of atolls,
or reclamation of parts of a city
that are damaged by water.
So, one of these examples
would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,
and is built upon wooden piles.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible
for the protocell technology that we're working with
to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan
has come up with a series of designs that show us
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef
underneath the city.
So, here is the technology we have today.
This is our protocell technology,
effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,
and depositing it in a very complex environment,
against natural materials.
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
Now, this is the very interesting part.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
What we need it to do is to be
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually
moving away from the light,
toward the dark foundations.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity,
we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone
very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,
effectively petrifying it.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology
in order for us to become ready
to test it out in a case-by-case basis
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology,
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture
that connects a city to the natural world
in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,
which means that this technology is just as appropriate
for developing countries as it is
for First World countries.
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials
as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,
and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
Secondly, these metabolic materials
have some of the properties of living systems,
which means they can perform in similar ways.
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions
within the practice of architecture.
And finally, an observer in the future
marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment
may find it almost impossible to tell
whether this structure
has been created by a natural process
or an artificial one.
Thank you.

As a boy,
I loved cars.
When I turned 18,
I lost my best friend to a car accident.
Like this.
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life
to saving one million people
every year.
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
I saw the concept first
in the DARPA Grand Challenges
where the U.S. government issued a prize
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
And even though a hundred teams were there,
these cars went nowhere.
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
We built the hardware and the software.
We made it learn from us,
and we set it free in the desert.
And the unimaginable happened:
it became the first car
to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,
winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.
Since, our work has focused
on building driving cars
that can drive anywhere by themselves --
any street in California.
We've driven 140,000 miles.
Our cars have sensors
by which they magically can see
everything around them
and make decisions
about every aspect of driving.
It's the perfect driving mechanism.
We've driven in cities,
like in San Francisco here.
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
We've encountered joggers,
busy highways, toll booths,
and this is without a person in the loop;
the car just drives itself.
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,
people didn't even notice.
Mountain roads,
day and night,
and even crooked Lombard Street
in San Francisco.

Sometimes our cars get so crazy,
they even do little stunts.
 Man: Oh, my God.
What?
Second Man: It's driving itself.
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
but I can do something for all the people who died.
Do you know that driving accidents
are the number one cause of death for young people?
And do you realize that almost all of those
are due to human error
and not machine error,
and can therefore be prevented by machines?
Do you realize
that we could change the capacity of highways
by a factor of two or three
if we didn't rely on human precision
on staying in the lane --
improve body position
and therefore drive a little bit closer together
on a little bit narrower lanes,
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
Do you realize that you, TED users,
spend an average
of 52 minutes per day
in traffic,
wasting your time
on your daily commute?
You could regain this time.
This is four billion hours
wasted in this country alone.
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,
and I'm really looking forward to a time
when generations after us look back at us
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
Thank you.

This is a river.
This is a stream.
This is a river.
This is happening all over the country.
There are tens of thousands of miles
of dewatered streams in the United States.
On this map,
the colored areas represent water conflicts.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
The reasons vary state to state,
but mostly in the details.
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams
in Montana alone.
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
They're the veins of the ecosystem,
and they're often empty veins.
I want to tell you the story
of just one of these streams
because it's an archetype for the larger story.
This is Prickly Pear Creek.
It runs through a populated area
from East Helena to Lake Helena.
It supports wild fish
including cutthroat, brown
and rainbow trout.
Nearly every year
for more than a hundred years,
it's looked like this in the summer.
How did we get here?
Well, it started back in the late 1800s
when people started settling in places like Montana.
In short, there was a lot of water
and there weren't very many people.
But as more people showed up wanting water,
the folks who were there first got a little concerned,
and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
It basically said, everybody near the stream
can share in the stream.
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream,
and the folks who were there first
got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
There were precedent-setting suits
in 1870 and 1872,
both involving Prickly Pear Creek.
And in 1921,
the Montana Supreme Court
ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear
that the folks who were there first
had the first, or "senior water rights."
These senior water rights are key.
The problem is that all over the west now
it looks like this.
Some of these creeks
have claims for 50 to 100 times more water
than is actually in the stream.
And the senior water rights holders,
if they don't use their water right,
they risk losing their water right,
along with the economic value that goes with it.
So they have no incentive to conserve.
So it's not just about the number of people;
the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve
because you can lose your water right if you don't use it.
So after decades of lawsuits
and 140 years, now, of experience,
we still have this.
It's a broken system.
There's a disincentive to conserve,
because, if you don't use your water right,
you can lose your water right.
And I'm sure you all know, this has created significant conflicts
between the agricultural and environmental communities.
Okay. Now I'm going to change gears here.
Most of you will be happy to know
that the rest of the presentation's free,
and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer.

There's another thing happening around the country,
which is that companies are starting to get concerned
about their water footprint.
They're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water,
they're trying to be really efficient with their water use,
and they're concerned about how their water use
affects the image of their brand.
Well, it's a national problem,
but I'm going to tell you another story from Montana,
and it involves beer.
I bet you didn't know, it takes about 5 pints of water
to make a pint of beer.
If you include all the drain,
it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer.
Now the brewers in Montana
have already done a lot
to reduce their water consumption,
but they still use millions of gallons of water.
I mean, there's water in beer.
So what can they do
about this remaining water footprint
that can have serious effects
on the ecosystem?
These ecosystems are really important
to the Montana brewers and their customers.
After all, there's a strong correlation
between water and fishing,
and for some, there's a strong correlation
between fishing and beer.

So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned,
and they're looking for some way to address the problem.
So how can they address this remaining water footprint?
Remember Prickly Pear.
Up until now,
business water stewardship
has been limited to measuring and reducing,
and we're suggesting that the next step
is to restore.
Remember Prickly Pear.
It's a broken system.
You've got a disincentive to conserve,
because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds --
the world of the companies
with their water footprints
and the world of the farmers
with their senior water rights on these creeks.
In some states,
senior water rights holders
can leave their water in-stream
while legally protecting it from others
and maintaining their water right.
After all,
it is their water right,
and if they want to use that water right
to help the fish grow in the stream,
it's their right to do so.
But they have no incentive to do so.
So, working with local water trusts,
we created an incentive to do so.
We pay them to leave their water in-stream.
That's what's happening here.
This individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion,
leaving the water in the stream.
He doesn't lose the water right,
he just chooses to apply that right,
or some portion of it,
to the stream, instead of to the land.
Because he's the senior water rights holder,
he can protect the water from other users in the stream.
Okay?
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream.
This guy's measuring the water
that this leaves in the stream.
We then take the measured water,
we divide it into thousand-gallon increments.
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate,
and then the brewers and others
buy those certificates
as a way to return water
to these degraded ecosystems.
The brewers pay
to restore water to the stream.
It provides a simple, inexpensive
and measurable way
to return water to these degraded ecosystems,
while giving farmers an economic choice
and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints
an easy way to deal with them.
After 140 years of conflict
and 100 years of dry streams,
a circumstance that litigation and regulation
has not solved,
we put together a market-based,
willing buyer, willing seller solution --
a solution that does not require litigation.
It's about giving
folks concerned about their water footprints
a real opportunity
to put water where it's critically needed,
into these degraded ecosystems,
while at the same time
providing farmers
a meaningful economic choice
about how their water is used.
These transactions create allies, not enemies.
They connect people rather than dividing them.
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities.
And most importantly, it's working.
We've returned more than four billion gallons of water
to degraded ecosystems.
We've connected senior water rights holders
with brewers in Montana,
with hotels and tea companies in Oregon
and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
And when we make these connections,
we can and we do
turn this into this.
Thank you very much.

So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
He certainly doesn't look like me.
He looks like this.
His name is Matthieu Ricard.
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
Well it turns out
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
And you do that by measuring the relative activation
of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,
versus the right prefrontal cortex.
And Matthieu's happiness measure
is off the charts.
He's by far the happiest man
ever measured by science.
Which leads us to a question:
What was he thinking when he was being measured?
Perhaps something very naughty.

Actually, he was meditating
on compassion.
Matthieu's own experience
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.
Reading about Matthieu
was one of the pivotal moments of my life.
My dream
is to create the conditions
for world peace in my lifetime --
and to do that
by creating the conditions
for inner peace
and compassion
on a global scale.
And learning about Matthieu
gave me a new angle to look at my work.
Matthieu's brain scan shows
that compassion is not a chore.
Compassion is something that creates happiness.
Compassion is fun.
And that mind-blowing insight
changes the entire game.
Because if compassion was a chore,
nobody's going to do it,
except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
But if compassion was fun,
everybody's going to do it.
Therefore,
to create the conditions for global compassion,
all we have to do
is to reframe compassion
as something that is fun.
But fun is not enough.
What if compassion
is also profitable?
What if compassion is also good for business?
Then, every boss, every manager in the world,
will want to have compassion --
like this.
That would create the conditions
for world peace.
So, I started paying attention
to what compassion looks like in a business setting.
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --
in Google, my company.
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,
but Google is the place I'm familiar with
because I've been there for 10 years,
so I'll use Google as the case study.
Google is a company
born of idealism.
It's a company that thrives on idealism.
And maybe because of that,
compassion is organic
and widespread company-wide.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion
almost always follow the same pattern.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
It starts with a small group of Googlers
taking the initiative to do something.
And they don't usually ask for permission;
they just go ahead and do it,
and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
And sometimes it gets big enough
to become official.
So in other words,
it almost always starts from the bottom up.
And let me give you some examples.
The first example is the largest annual community event --
where Googlers from around the world
donate their labor to their local communities --
was initiated and organized
by three employees
before it became official,
because it just became too big.
Another example, three Googlers --
a chef, an engineer
and, most funny, a massage therapist --
three of them, they learned about a region in India
where 200,000 people live
without a single medical facility.
So what do they do?
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
And they raise enough money to build this hospital --
the first hospital of its kind
for 200,000 people.
During the Haiti earthquake,
a number of engineers and product managers
spontaneously came together
and stayed overnight
to build a tool
to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
And expressions of compassion
are also found in our international offices.
In China for example,
one mid-level employee
initiated the largest social action competition in China,
involving more than 1,000 schools in China,
working on issues
such as education, poverty,
health care and the environment.
There is so much organic social action
all around Google
that the company decided to form
a social responsibility team
just to support these efforts.
And this idea, again,
came from the grassroots,
from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions
and volunteered themselves for the job.
And I found it fascinating
that the social responsibility team
was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"
and the company said, "Yes."
So it turns out
that Google is a compassionate company,
because Googlers found
compassion to be fun.
But again, fun is not enough.
There are also real business benefits.
So what are they?
The first benefit of compassion
is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
What does that mean?
There are three components of compassion.
There is the affective component,
which is, "I feel for you."
There is the cognitive component,
which is, "I understand you."
And there is a motivational component,
which is, "I want to help you."
So what has this got to do with business leadership?
According to a very comprehensive study
led by Jim Collins,
and documented in the book "Good to Great,"
it takes a very special kind of leader
to bring a company
from goodness to greatness.
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."
These are leaders
who, in addition to being highly capable,
possess two important qualities,
and they are
humility and ambition.
These are leaders
who are highly ambitious for the greater good.
And because they're ambitious for a greater good,
they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
And they, according to the research,
make the best business leaders.
And if you look at these qualities
in the context of compassion,
we find
that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --
understanding people and empathizing with people --
inhibits, tones down,
what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,
therefore creating the conditions
for humility.
The motivational component of compassion
creates ambition for greater good.
In other words,
compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
And this is the first compelling business benefit.
The second compelling benefit of compassion
is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
Employees mutually inspire each other
towards greater good.
It creates a vibrant, energetic community
where people admire and respect each other.
I mean, you come to work in the morning,
and you work with three guys
who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --
your own coworkers?
So this mutual inspiration
promotes collaboration,
initiative and creativity.
It makes us a highly effective company.
So, having said all that,
what is the secret formula
for brewing compassion
in the corporate setting?
In our experience,
there are three ingredients.
The first ingredient
is to create a culture
of passionate concern
for the greater good.
So always think:
how is your company and your job
serving the greater good?
Or, how can you further serve
the greater good?
This awareness of serving the greater good
is very self-inspiring
and it creates fertile ground
for compassion to grow in.
That's one.
The second ingredient
is autonomy.
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
And one of our most popular managers jokes that,
this is what he says,
Google is a place
where the inmates run the asylum."
And he considers himself one of the inmates.
If you already have
a culture of compassion
and idealism
and you let your people roam free,
they will do the right thing
in the most compassionate way.
The third ingredient
is to focus on inner development
and personal growth.
Leadership training in Google, for example,
places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,
such as self-awareness, self-mastery,
empathy and compassion,
because we believe
that leadership begins
with character.
We even created a seven-week curriculum
on emotion intelligence,
which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
It's less naughty than it sounds.
So I'm an engineer by training,
but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,
which I find kind of funny,
because this is a company that trusts an engineer
to teach emotion intelligence.
What a company.

So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?
It works in three steps.
The first step
is attention training.
Attention is the basis
of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
Therefore, any curriculum
for training emotion intelligence
has to begin with attention training.
The idea here is to train attention
to create a quality of mind
that is calm and clear
at the same time.
And this creates the foundation
for emotion intelligence.
The second step follows the first step.
The second step is developing self-knowledge
and self-mastery.
So using the supercharged attention from step one,
we create a high-resolution perception
into the cognitive and emotive processes.
What does that mean?
It means being able to observe our thought stream
and the process of emotion
with high clarity,
objectivity
and from a third-person perspective.
And once you can do that,
you create the kind of self-knowledge
that enables self-mastery.
The third step, following the second step,
is to create new mental habits.
What does that mean? Imagine this.
Imagine whenever you meet any other person,
any time you meet a person,
your habitual, instinctive first thought
is, "I want you to be happy.
I want you to be happy."
Imagine you can do that.
Having this habit, this mental habit,
changes everything at work.
Because this good will
is unconsciously picked up by other people,
and it creates trust,
and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
And this also creates the conditions
for compassion in the workplace.
Someday, we hope to open-source
Search Inside Yourself
so that everybody in the corporate world
will at least be able to use it as a reference.
And in closing,
I want to end the same place I started,
with happiness.
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --
the Dalai Lama,
who said, "If you want others to be happy,
practice compassion.
If you want to be happy,
practice compassion."
I found this to be true,
both on the individual level
and at a corporate level.
And I hope that compassion
will be both fun and profitable for you too.
Thank you.

In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,
and I met a 12-year-old boy
who had been tortured
and was denied access to counsel.
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized
that for the hundreds of letters I had written
for political prisoners, that I would never have
written a letter for him,
because he was not a 12-year-old boy who
had done something important for anybody.
He was not a political prisoner.
He was a 12-year-old boy who had
stolen a bicycle.
What I also realized at that point was that
it was not only Cambodia, but
of the 113
developing countries that torture,
93 of these countries have all passed laws
that say you have a right to a lawyer
and you have a right not to be tortured.
And what I recognized was that there was an
incredible window of opportunity for us
as a world community to come together
and end torture as an investigative tool.
We often think of torture as being
political torture or reserved for
just the worst, but, in fact,
95 percent of torture today
is not for political prisoners.
It is for people who are
in broken-down legal systems,
and unfortunately because torture is
the cheapest form of investigation --
it's cheaper than having a legal system,
cheaper than having a lawyer
and early access to counsel --
it is what happens most of the time.
I believe today that it is possible for us
as a world community, if we make a decision,
to come together and end torture
as an investigative tool in our lifetime,
but it will require three things.
First is the training, empowerment,
and connection of defenders worldwide.
The second is insuring that there is
systematic early access to counsel.
And the third is commitment.
So in the year 2000,
I began to wonder,
what if we came together?
Could we do something
for these 93 countries?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice
which has a specific mission of
ending torture as an investigative tool
and implementing due process rights
in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers
at an early stage in police stations
and in courtrooms.
My first experiences, though, did come
from Cambodia, and at the time I remember
first coming to Cambodia and there were,
in 1994, still less than
10 attorneys in the country because
the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
And even 20 years later, there was only
10 lawyers in the country, so consequently
you'd walk into a prison and
not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,
you'd meet women and you'd say,
Why are you here? Women would say,
Well I've been here for 10 years because
my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
The first group of defenders came together
and I still remember, as I was training, I said,
Okay, what do you do for an investigation?
And there was silence in the class, and finally
one woman stood up, [inaudible name],
and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."
She said, "I have defended more than
a hundred people, and I've never had to do
any investigation,
because they all come with confessions."
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that
number one, the confessions
might not be reliable, but number two,
we did not want to encourage the police
to keep doing this, especially
as it was now against the law.
And it took a lot of courage for these
defenders to decide that they would
begin to stand up and support each other
in implementing these laws.
And I still remember the first cases where
they came, all 25 together, she would
stand up, and they were in the back, and
they would support her, and the judges kept
saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things
the exact same way we've been doing them."
But one day the perfect case came, and it
was a woman who was a vegetable seller,
she was sitting outside of a house.
She said she actually saw the person
run out who she thinks stole
whatever the jewelry was, but the police
came, they got her, there was nothing on her.
She was pregnant at the time. She had
cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
And when they brought her case
to the judge, for the first time he stood up
and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence
except for your torture confession
and you will be released."
And the defenders began to take cases
over and over again and
you will see, they have step by step began
to change the course of history in Cambodia.
But Cambodia is not alone.
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?
Or is it other countries?
But it is in so many countries.
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't
a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy
for stealing a mobile phone.
Or a woman, I picked up her baby,
really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."
It wasn't a baby, she was three.
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"
because she was accused of stealing
two diapers and an iron for her baby and
still had been in prison.
And when I walked up to the prison director,
I said, "You've got to let her out.
A judge would let her out."
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,
but look at my prison. Eighty percent
of the two thousand people here
are without a lawyer. What can we do?"
So lawyers began to courageously
stand up together to organize a system
where they can take cases.
But we realized that it's not only the training
of the lawyers, but the connection
of the lawyers that makes a difference.
For example, in Cambodia, it was that
[inaudible name] did not go alone
but she had 24 lawyers with her
who stood up together. And in the same way,
in China, they always tell me,
It's like a fresh wind in the desert
when we can come together."
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,
after coming out of a prison where everybody
stood up and said, "I've been here
for one year, eight years, 12 years
without a lawyer,"
he came and we had a training together
and he said, "I have heard it said" --
because he had heard people mumbling
and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that
we cannot help to create justice
because we do not have the resources."
And then he said, "But I want you to know
that the lack of resources
is never an excuse for injustice."
And with that, he successfully
organized 68 lawyers who have been
systematically taking the cases.
The key that we see, though, is training
and then early access.
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired
to meet with another group of lawyers,
and what they told me is that they said,
Hey, look, we don't have police
on the streets now. The police are
one of the main reasons why we had
the revolution. They were torturing everybody
all the time."
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions
of dollars that have recently gone in
to the development of the legal system here.
What's going on?"
I met with one of the development agencies,
and they were training prosecutors
and judges, which is the normal bias,
as opposed to defenders.
And they showed me a manual which
actually was an excellent manual.
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come
at the police station. It was perfect.
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.
But I said to them, "I just have one question,
which is, by the time that everybody got to
the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"
And after a pause, they said,
They had been tortured.
So the pieces are,
not only the training of the lawyers, but
us finding a way to systematically implement
early access to counsel, because they are
the safeguard in the system
for people who are being tortured.
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the
fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds
like we could do it, but can we really do it?"
Because it sounds big.
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
The first reason is the people on the ground
who find ways of creating miracles
because of their commitment.
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about
in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world
who are looking for these pieces.
We have a program called JusticeMakers,
and we realized there are people that are
courageous and want to do things, but
how can we support them?
So it's an online contest where it's only
five thousand dollars if you come up with
and innovative way of implementing justice.
And there are 30 JusticeMakers
throughout the world, from Sri Lanka
to Swaziland to the DRC, who with
five thousand dollars do amazing things,
through SMS programs,
through paralegal programs,
through whatever they can do.
And it's not only these JusticeMakers,
but people we courageously see
figure out who their networks are
and how they can move it forward.
So in China, for instance, great laws
came out where it says police cannot
torture people or they will be punished.
And I was sitting side by side with one of our
very courageous lawyers, and said,
How can we get this out? How can we
make sure that this is implemented?
This is fantastic." And he said to me,
Well, do you have money? And I said,
No. And he said, "That's okay,
we can still figure it out."
And on December 4, he organized
three thousand members
of the Youth Communist League,
from 14 of the top law schools,
who organized themselves, developed
posters with the new laws, and went
to the police stations and began what he says
is a non-violent legal revolution
to protect citizen rights.
So I talked about the fact that we need
to train and support defenders.
We need to systematically implement
early access to counsel.
But the third and most important thing is that
we make a commitment to this.
And people often say to me, "You know,
this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
Never going to happen."
And the reason that I think that
those words are interesting is because
those were the same kinds of words
that were used for people who decided
they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
It began with a small group of people
who decided they would commit.
Now, there's one of our favorite poems
from the defenders, which they share
from each other, is:
Take courage friends, the road is often long,
the path is never clear,
and the stakes are very high,
but deep down, you are not alone."
And I believe that if we can come together
as a world community to support not only
defenders, but also everyone in the system
who is looking towards it,
we can end torture as an investigative tool.
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --
and I'd be happy to talk to you
at any point -- "But what can I really do?"
Well, I would say this. First of all,
you know what you can do. But second of all,
I would leave you with the story of Vishna,
who actually was my inspiration
for starting International Bridges to Justice.
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him
who was born in a Cambodian prison
in Kandal Province. But because he was
born in the prison, everybody loved him,
including the guards, so he was the only one
who was allowed to come
in and out of the bars.
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time
that Vishna was getting bigger,
which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
So he would come to the first bar,
the second bar and then the third bar,
and then really slowly move his head
so he could fit through, and come back,
third, second, first. And he would
grab my pinkie, because what he wanted
to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
You know, he never quite made it to
all of them every day, but he wanted to visit
all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,
and he would put his fingers through.
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron
corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
And most of the prisoners said that he was
their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they
looked forward to him. And I was like,
here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
He was born in a prison with almost nothing,
no material goods, but he had a sense of
his own heroic journey, which I believe
we are all born into. He said,
Probably I can't do everything.
But I'm one. I can do something.
And I will do the one thing that I can do."
So I thank you for having the prophetic
imagination to imagine the shaping
of a new world with us together,
and invite you into this journey with us.
Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud
where I can just lie down with my belly down,
like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.
And I can basically look everywhere I want,
see every movie I've always wanted to see.
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes
in the subway in New York when you're reading,
there's something really soothing and easy.
Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,
because I discovered ...
it took me a while to understand it,
but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable
with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,
and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story.
Just to give you an example:
this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.
We were in Queens,
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,
so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.
That was one of the funnest moments of my career.
But it's not only that.
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;
it's its 50th anniversary this year.
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,
trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --
and the movie starts playing in my head already.
And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces
it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.
And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition
is going to have the same effect on you.
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
you know when they do homeworks at home?
Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go
into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag
and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray.
So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,
and at MoMA we put out some books
just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.
And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,
and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions.
And a lot of nationalism came in.
For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,
but they were very proud
so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.
And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --
they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails.
And I keep it going, and I just got,

also, this suggestion from Milan:
it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;
it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan
to define all the lanes of traffic.
So, think of your own,
send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome.
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more
what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.
I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,
and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism
that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible.
In Italy, in Milan especially,
contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.
But design -- oh, my God.
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,
is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that
we are all so sophisticated.
It's just what you find at the store.
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.
I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is
and take you to the galleries.
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
It's really interesting:
what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of
this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --
decoration, interior decoration.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way
to design gas masks for people,
because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.
So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,
so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke.
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler
can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.
And then they make a little tent for the baby.
However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,
and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,
but still, it's part of my same field of passion.
What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to
harness the power of MoMA
because it's great to work there. You really have power
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.
I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,
which is to try and see what's going on in the world
and try to use that authority in order to make things better.
There have been many episodes,
and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,
but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather --
I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --
Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time
were involved in two competitions:
one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948
was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war
that then sparked a whole line of furniture.
And then there was good design for very low price.
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about
pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.
So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called
Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design
in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels
from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;
at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.
And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these
beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.
So you see, the range is really quite diverse.
And then, for instance, this other exhibition
that was entitled Workspheres in 2001,
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for
the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.
And you see IDEO there.
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.
The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top
of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --
it's a very famous Italian song.
And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,
and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:
designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,
current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --
is much more than the sum of its parts.
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis
that is really quite amazing
and also quite hilarious.
The idea behind her work was that
at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.
Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together."
Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001.
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,
but I don't want to focus on my shows.
I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.
I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick."
I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day
I have to ask, "What does that mean?"
So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that
there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.
Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead,
and therefore, he was a maverick.
So, designers do need to be mavericks,
because the best way to design a successful object --
and also an object that we were missing before --
is to pretend that either it never existed
or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA
and it ended at the beginning of last year.
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition
until, slowly but surely, it came back --
as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --
and it was about protection and safety.
But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to
these kind of water-sterilizing straws,
so it was really wide-ranging.
It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.
But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;
design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest
and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --
it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart
so your heartbeat is amplified --
and the police is reminded;
it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit
will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police.
So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately
functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby
did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,
like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor
so it disappears completely and you can hide away;
or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article
on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --
I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;
or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations.
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that
the ultimate shelter is your sense of self,
and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.
This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer
that's done this series of Capsters.
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,
do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves.
And sometimes by doing this kind of research,
you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.
Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with
some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial
stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.
They're quite beautiful.
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --
because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --
all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself
in the mirror and regain a sense of self.
Design really looks upon the whole world
and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker
and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,
and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time
I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality.
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,
and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of
design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.
This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.
So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because
they're so smart and economical.
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,
Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and
smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are
selling for an enormous amount of money.
But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself.
So really, design takes everything into account,
and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,
as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,
designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.
Sometimes hammer-on.
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes
your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects
that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples
to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.

It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,
explain how the innovation in the military industry --
therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the
civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.
And that makes sense.
In moments of war there's great technological innovation,
and in the world you have to do without --
well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,
you had to do without aluminum.
And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden
available for the civilian market.
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair
by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:
fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden.
I think that this is a strange moment.
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,
just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,
so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.
But it surely is a very important moment for design,
because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing
technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,
but also the idea of sustainability --
which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,
but also sustainability of human interrelationships --
is very much part of the work of so many designers.
And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors
rather than on objects.
Especially the good ones, not all of them.
I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,
which is quite fantastic.
He's another young designer from France who's working --
and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --
on new ways to engage patients, especially children,
in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty.
For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine
that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,
so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved
in this particular kind of delivery.
Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve
you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth
so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally.
The next show that I'm going to work on --
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --
is about the relationship between design and science.
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --
the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --
and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,
and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small
to make it very big and very meaningful.
Thank you. 
So what's image got do with it?
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send
a lot of subliminal messages,
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
that have come up.
But I'm going to try and do something different,
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues
that we've been talking about.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,
as you can see.
We're not the only ones.


And you know, it's amazing.
I mean, we need a whole conference
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
Just think about that, you know?
And this is typically what we've been talking about,
the role that the media plays in focusing
just on the negative stuff.
Now, why is that a problem?
A typical disaster story:
disease, corruption, poverty.
And some of you might be standing here thinking,
saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,
and all you privileged people come here, saying,
'Forget the poor people.
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans
who really need help."
And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
We start with poverty.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,
or being able to support family.
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
When things were bad, we had porridge.
And like many African families,
my parents could never save
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,
and things were always dicey.
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,
which was free.
And they adopted a very interesting
approach to education, which was
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
And what happened was,
because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,
I got kicked out pretty much every term.
You know, someone would come in with a list
of the people who haven't paid school fees,
and when they started getting pretty strict,
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And I remember thinking, I mean,
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
Because you know, as a kid
you're embarrassed and
you're sensitive, and everyone knows
you guys don't have money.
But they kept at it,
and I now understand why they did what they did.
They talk about corruption.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,
and provincial schools.
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,
a national school.
I missed the cutoff by one point.
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,
Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?
And my father said, "OK, listen.
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
You know, it's just one point. I mean,
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
So we went to the school,
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,
and because my father didn't have the right last name,
he was treated like dirt.
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,
you know, who do you think you are?
And, you know, you must be joking if you think
you can get a slot.
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,
and who had done much, much worse than I did,
and they had slots there.
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent
being humiliated in front of you, you know?
And we left, and I swore to myself,
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have
to beg for anything in my life."
They called me two weeks later, they're like,
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
 
Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
Disease.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
He never told anyone that he had AIDS,
his fear of the stigma was so strong.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time,
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
Because of doctor-patient privilege,
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --
read about the disease,
I pretty much realized what was going on.
The first time he got sick, he recovered.
But what happened was that he had to be on medication
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
You know, so money ran out.
He got sick again.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,
and he used to import, bring him, could
get him a generic version of it.
And that kept him going.
But the money ran out.
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash
for him to start the treatment until Monday.
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And finally, we figured, well, OK,
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
At least he'll get treated
while we try to figure out the money situation.
And he died when the ambulance was coming
to the hospital to take him.
And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --
imagine if this is all you know about me.
How would you look at me?
With pity, you know. Sadness.
And this is how you look at Africa.
This is the damage it causes.
You don't see the other side of me.
You don't see the blogger,
you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,
the vibrant person, you know?
And I just wanted to personalize that.
Because we talk about it in big terms,
and you wonder, you know, so what?
But it's damaging.
And I'm not unique, right?
Imagine if all you knew about William
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
And I was just moved.
I was actually crying during his presentation.
He was like, I try and I make.
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"

And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
When you focus just on the disasters --
 
-- we're ignoring the potential.
So, what is to be done?
First of all,
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
We heard about that yesterday.
We had some of them this morning.
And this is an example, you know,
blogging is one way of doing that.
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs
that was developed in South Africa.
So we need to start getting better.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make,
this is the Swahili Wikipedia.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
It only has five contributors.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --
is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
He's the only African who's contributing to this.
People, please. We can't whine and complain
the West is doing this.
What are we doing?
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
Why are we not generating our own content?
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
Reuters now integrates African blogs
into their coverage of Africa.
So, that's a start,
and we've heard of all their other initiatives.
The cheetah generation.
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.
And after all the hoopla of Live 8,
we're still not anywhere in the picture.
No, you're not.

But the point I'm trying to make, though,
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
And for those of you in the diaspora
who are struggling with where should I be,
should I move back,
should I stay?
You know, just jump.
The continent needs you.
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,
Covington and Burling, six figures.
With two paychecks, or three paychecks,
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
And because I'm needed here, you know?
I probably can win a prize for the most ways
to use a Harvard Law School degree
because of all the things I'm doing.
One is because I'm pretty aggressive,
and I try and find, you know, opportunities.
But there is such a need, you know?
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time
for an organization called Enablis
that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
We're now moving into East Africa.
And we give them business development services,
as well as financing loan and equity.
I've also set up a project in Kenya,
and what we do is we track the performance
of Kenyan MPs.
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
We've manually entered all the data there.
And you can get profiles of each MP,
questions they've asked in parliament.
We have a comment function,
where people can ask their MPs questions.
There are some MPs who participate,
and come back and ask.
And basically, we started this because we were tired
of complaining about our politicians.
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You're not just going to be accountable
out of the goodness of your heart.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
What are they doing?
You know, they're not going to change
just out of nowhere.
So we need new policies, we need --
where's that coming from, you know?
Another thing is that these leaders
are a reflection of our society.
We talk about African governments
like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
They come from us.
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
And how can we change that?
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start
inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
Where do we go from here?
I believe in the power of ideas.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,
because it can make a difference.
The other thing I want to urge you to do
is take an interest in the individual.
I've had lots of conversations about things I think
need to be happening in Africa.
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,
BBut it's not scalable, you know.
Give me something I can do with Paypal."
It's not that easy, you know?
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,
because usually the individual in Africa
carries a lot of people behind them.
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
I was helping her pay her tuition.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
I was paying her school fees.
A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
You know, she's now my baby sister.
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,
I am able to lift all those people.
So, don't underestimate that.
An example. This man changed my life.
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,
because he took an interest.
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,
this is an overeager student,
which we don't normally get in the United States,
because everyone else is cynical and jaded.
He called me to his office and said,
What do you want to do when you grow up?
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."
And he was like, "Why? You know,
we don't need another lawyer in the United States."
And he tried to talk me out of it,
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,
I'm poli-sci Ph.D.
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,
what I need to do to help you out."
It was like, "Where do you want to go?"
And to me at that time university --
I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,
and that was like heaven, OK,
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,
you have all these things going for you."
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,
and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard
for applying to law school.
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,
you're that good, OK?
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
And he built me up, you know?
And this is just an illustration.
You can meet other individuals here.
We just need a push.
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity
of us having to leave the continent
so that we can fulfill our potential.
You know, my vision is that my daughter,
and any other African child being born today,
can be whoever they want to be here,
without having to leave.
And they can have the possibility of transcending
the circumstances under which they were born.
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,
and you can move.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,
that doesn't define who you are.
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,
and the circumstances under which you were born,
determine the rest of your life.
I would like to see that change,
and the change starts with us.
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
Thank you.

I like to build stuff.
I've always liked to build stuff.
My team at Biosense,
a startup I co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends,
has built a technology called ToucHB,
which can do blood testing of hemoglobin
without pricks, without needles.
I believe
this is going to democratize health care.
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.

In fact, in 2009, I was even more clueless.
I had absolutely no idea
what was going to happen next.
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D.,
which was in a completely unrelated area
of how people interact, contributors interact,
how articles are formed in Wikipedia --
trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.
I was also building something
called the Copenhagen Wheel,
which is just a really beautiful, beautiful electric bike
at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab.
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai, my house,
back for a vacation.
So at that time
I was planning a road trip.
I visited a place called Parol
about two hours north of Mumbai.
This is a place where my friend, Abhishek Sen was interning.
He's a doctor there.
And that's his actual photograph.

So Abhishek actually made me wait.
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby.
I was waiting, and when he did emerge,
he was ashen-faced.
He told me that there had been two deaths;
the mother and child both had died.
The reason, he told me,
was something called post partum hemorrhage.
He explained this meant severe internal bleeding.
What was really shocking for me
was that he said that this is entirely due
to undiagnosed anemia.
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew --
that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.
It is something which probably the cure is known.
I mean, folic acid, iron tablets --
very cheap, affordable cures exist
to control anemia.
So why was this woman dying?
It was completely preventable.
Five minutes away from there,
I had the center, the medical center,
which was distributing subsidized iron tablets.
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me.
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.
My mom is a pediatrician, and I asked her.
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.
Take a blood sample
and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter.
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.
It's also available here or in any part, I guess,
in Europe and most cities in the world.
But this is not available in Parol.
Also, that woman who was operating the machine, the technician,
is not available in Parol.

Now this struck me as --
I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.
I got a friend of mine, an engineer, and three other doctors --
Abhishek joined the team --
and we wanted to solve this problem.
By the time I step down from here
there will be 10 people who have lost their lives
through a completely, completely preventable problem.
Now let me take you back to Parol.
You saw the woman there, the nurse.
In India this is called an ASHA worker.
It's essentially a village health worker, a matron.
She is really the center of the health care system.
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker,
not the doctor.
Now we knew we had to design something
which she could use.
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.
We knew it had to be something
which had no needles, no pricking,
so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste,
all those problems.
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.
And thirdly, it had to be something which she could carry in her kit.
She goes village to village doing screenings.
We thought we could build it,
so we built it.

But, but it didn't work.

So we built it again.
And we did this 32 times.

But I'm very excited to tell you
that last year
we did build it -- it works.
And I have it here in my purse.
So this is a machine
called the ToucHB Quik.
What it does
is it measures my hemoglobin, oxygen and pulse rate.
I put it on my finger, switch it on,
and in about 20 seconds
it'll give me, on the little screen here,
a value of hemoglobin,
oxygen saturation and heart rate.
This will help ASHA workers
diagnose anemia at the point of care.

I'll explain a little bit about how it works.
You might have seen a little light inside of it.
In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light.
And we essentially pass light
right through the tissue,
and from understanding how much of it is transmitted,
how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed,
we can figure out
how much hemoglobin is there in the blood.
And this is something which is based on a principle
called photoplethysmography.
We are actually really very excited
about what else non-invasive techniques like this
will be able to crack in the future.
One of the things which my intern here, Pratesh, built
is a mobile application,
which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go.
There's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it.
But fundamentally,
what I believe is that the map behind of me
is called basically the map of anemia.
It's the death rates caused by anemia globally.
You'll notice, of course,
that there are hot spots --
South Asia, Africa.
My business plan is very simple.
I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world.
That's a simple bottom-line business plan.
And by the time I'm done, in 2020,
when the WHO publishes the data again,
this is going to be the map of anemia.

Thank you.

I'm going to tell you a little bit
about my TEDxHouston Talk.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk
with the worst vulnerability hangover
of my life.
And I actually didn't leave my house
for about three days.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
And I sat down, and she said,
God, you look like hell.
I said, "Thanks. I feel really --
I'm not functioning."
And she said, "What's going on?"
And I said, "I just told
500 people
that I became a researcher
to avoid vulnerability.
And that when being vulnerable
emerged from my data,
as absolutely essential
to whole-hearted living,
I told these 500 people
that I had a breakdown.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"

And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.
It was not really you.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
But it was great."
And I said,
This can't happen.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."

And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
And I said, "Let me ask you something."
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college
and really wild and kind of dumb?"
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message
on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
and then erase the tape?"

And she goes, "Uh ... no."

So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was,
Yeah, me neither.
That ... me neither."
And I'm thinking to myself,
Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
So I looked back up and she said,
Are you really going to try to break in
and steal the video
before they put it on YouTube?"
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."

She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."

And then I looked at her and I said something
that at the time felt a little dramatic,
but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
I said,
If 500 turns into 1,000
or 2,000,
my life is over."

I had no contingency plan for four million.

And my life did end when that happened.
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending
is that I learned something hard about myself,
and that was that,
as much as I would frustrated
about not being able to get my work out to the world,
there was a part of me that was working very hard
to engineer staying small,
staying right under the radar.
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
The first is
vulnerability is not weakness.
And that myth
is profoundly dangerous.
Let me ask you honestly --
and I'll give you this warning,
I'm trained as a therapist,
so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --
so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome --
how many of you honestly,
when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable
or saying something vulnerable,
think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?"
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
The majority of people.
Now let me ask you this question:
This past week at TED,
how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here,
thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability
as emotional risk,
exposure, uncertainty.
It fuels our daily lives.
And I've come to the belief --
this is my 12th year doing this research --
that vulnerability
is our most accurate measurement
of courage --
to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen,
to be honest.
One of the weird things that's happened
is, after the TED explosion,
I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country --
everyone from schools and parent meetings
to Fortune 500 companies.
And so many of the calls went like this,
Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
We'd like you to come in and speak.
We'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."

What would you like for me to talk about?
There's three big answers.
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector:
innovation, creativity
and change.
So let me go on the record
and say,
vulnerability is the birthplace
of innovation, creativity and change.

To create is to make something
that has never existed before.
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
Adaptability to change
is all about vulnerability.
The second thing,
in addition to really finally understanding
the relationship between vulnerability and courage,
the second thing I learned is this:
We have to talk about shame.
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
When I became a "vulnerability researcher"
and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk --
and I'm not kidding.
I'll give you an example.
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store
buying goggles and shin guards
and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear:
Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!

I'm a fifth generation Texan.
Our family motto is "Lock and load."
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
So I'm like,
just keep walking, she's on my six.

And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
I turn around, I go, "Hi."
She's right here and she said,
You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown.

At this point
parents are, like, pulling their children close.
Look away.
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life,
I look at her and I actually say,
It was a frickin' spiritual awakening.


And she looks back and does this,
I know.
And she said,
We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.
Then we read your book
and we renamed ourselves
'The Breakdown Babes.'"
And she said, "Our tagline is:
'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'"

You can only imagine
what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
So when I became Vulnerability TED,
like an action figure --
like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED --
I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind,
because I spent six years studying shame
before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic,
no one wants to talk about it.
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
What do you do? "I study shame." "Oh."

And I see you.

But in surviving this last year,
I was reminded of a cardinal rule --
not a research rule,
but a moral imperative
from my upbringing --
you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
And I did not learn about vulnerability
and courage and creativity and innovation
from studying vulnerability.
I learned about these things
from studying shame.
And so I want to walk you in
to shame.
Jungian analysts call shame
the swampland of the soul.
And we're going to walk in.
And the purpose is not to walk in
and construct a home and live there.
It is to put on some galoshes
and walk through and find our way around.
Here's why.
We heard the most compelling call ever
to have a conversation in this country,
and I think globally,
around race, right?
Yes? We heard that.
Yes?
Cannot have that conversation without shame,
because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
And when people start talking about privilege,
they get paralyzed by shame.
We heard a brilliant simple solution
to not killing people in surgery,
which is have a checklist.
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame,
because when they teach those folks how to suture,
they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth
to being all-powerful.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow
so I didn't mess it up here.
Myshkin Ingawale,
I hope I did right by you.

I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And he got up and he explained
how he was driven to create
some technology to help test for anemia
because people were dying unnecessarily.
And he said, "I saw this need.
So you know what I did? I made it."
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
And he said, "And it didn't work.
And then I made it 32 more times,
and then it worked."
You know what the big secret about TED is?
I can't wait to tell people this.
I guess I'm doing it right now.

This is like the failure conference.
No, it is.

You know why this place is amazing?
Because very few people here
are afraid to fail.
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
I've failed miserably, many times.
I don't think the world understands that
because of shame.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year
by Theodore Roosevelt.
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
And it goes like this:
It is not the critic who counts.
It is not the man who sits and points out
how the doer of deeds could have done things better
and how he falls and stumbles.
The credit goes to the man in the arena
whose face is marred
with dust and blood and sweat.
But when he's in the arena,
at best he wins,
and at worst he loses,
but when he fails, when he loses,
he does so daring greatly."
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
That's what life is about, about daring greatly,
about being in the arena.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door,
and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this,"
shame is the gremlin
who says, "Uh, uh.
You're not good enough.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg,
he was in Sing Sing.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough
or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."
Shame is that thing.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in
and say, "I'm going to do this,"
we look up and the critic that we see
pointing and laughing,
99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes --
never good enough
and, if you can talk it out of that one,
who do you think you are?
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Shame is "I am bad."
Guilt is "I did something bad."
How many of you,
if you did something that was hurtful to me,
would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
How many of you would be willing to say that?
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
And here's what you need to know.
Shame is highly, highly correlated
with addiction, depression, violence, aggression,
bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
And here's what you even need to know more.
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do
up against who we want to be
is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
The other thing you need to know about shame
is it's absolutely organized by gender.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris,
it's going to feel the same.
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame
are people who have no capacity
for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame;
no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
Shame feels the same for men and women,
but it's organized by gender.
For women,
the best example I can give you
is Enjoli
the commercial:
I can put the wash on the line,
pack the lunches, hand out the kisses
and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan
and never let you forget you're a man."
For women, shame is do it all,
do it perfectly
and never let them see you sweat.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold,
but I guarantee you,
it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.

Shame, for women, is this web
of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations
about who we're supposed to be.
And it's a straight-jacket.
For men,
shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
Shame is one,
do not be perceived as what?
Weak.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing,
said, "I love what you have to say about shame,
I'm curious why you didn't mention men."
And I said, "I don't study men."
And he said, "That's convenient."

And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Because you say to reach out,
tell our story,
be vulnerable.
But you see those books you just signed
for my wife and my three daughters?"
I said, "Yeah."
They'd rather me die on top of my white horse
than watch me fall down.
When we reach out and be vulnerable
we get the shit beat out of us.
And don't tell me
it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads,
because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
So I started interviewing men
and asking questions.
And what I learned is this:
You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man
in real vulnerability and fear,
I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman
who's just had it,
she can't do it all anymore,
and his first response is not,
I unloaded the dishwasher,
but he really listens --
because that's all we need --
I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
And to get out from underneath it,
to find our way back to each other,
we have to understand how it affects us
and how it affects the way we're parenting,
the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
The top answers in this country:
nice, thin, modest
and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men,
what do men in this country need to do
to conform with male norms,
the answers were:
always show emotional control, work is first,
pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other,
we have to understand and know empathy,
because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish,
it needs three things to grow exponentially:
secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy,
it can't survive.
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle:
me too.
And so I'll leave you with this thought.
If we're going to find our way
back to each other,
vulnerability is going to be that path.
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena,
because I think I did it my whole life,
and think to myself,
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass
when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
And that is seductive.
But the truth is that never happens.
And even if you got as perfect as you could
and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster
when you got in there,
that's not what we want to see.
We want you to go in.
We want to be with you and across from you.
And we just want,
for ourselves and the people we care about
and the people we work with,
to dare greatly.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.

It is a dream of mankind
to fly like a bird.
Birds are very agile.
They fly, not with rotating components,
so they fly only by flapping their wings.
So we looked at the birds,
and we tried to make a model
that is powerful, ultralight,
and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities
that would fly by its own
and only by flapping its wings.
So what would be better [than] to use
the Herring Gull, in its freedom,
circling and swooping over the sea,
and [to] use this as a role model?
So we bring a team together.
There are generalists and also specialists
in the field of aerodynamics
in the field of building gliders.
And the task was to build
an ultralight indoor-flying model
that is able to fly over your heads.
So be careful later on.
And this was one issue:
to build it that lightweight
that no one would be hurt
if it fell down.
So why do we do all this?
We are a company in the field of automation,
and we'd like to do very lightweight structures
because that's energy efficient,
and we'd like to learn more about
pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
So I now would like you
to [put] your seat belts on
and put your hats [on].
So maybe we'll try it once --
to fly a SmartBird.
Thank you.



So we can now
look at the SmartBird.
So here is one without a skin.
We have a wingspan of about two meters.
The length is one meter and six,
and the weight,
it is only 450 grams.
And it is all out of carbon fiber.
In the middle we have a motor,
and we also have a gear in it,
and we use the gear
to transfer the circulation of the motor.
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors,
so we know exactly where
the wing is.
And if we now beat up and down ...
we have the possibility
to fly like a bird.
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion,
and if you go up,
the wings are not that large,
and it is easier to get up.
So, the next thing we did,
or the challenges we did,
was to coordinate this movement.
We have to turn it, go up and go down.
We have a split wing.
With a split wing
we get the lift at the upper wing,
and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
Also, we see
how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge about
the electromechanical efficiency
and then we can calculate
the aerodynamic efficiency.
So therefore,
it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,
from 30 percent
up to 80 percent.
Next thing we have to do,
we have to control and regulate
the whole structure.
Only if you control and regulate it,
you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
So the overall consumption of energy
is about 25 watts at takeoff
and 16 to 18 watts in flight.
Thank you.

Bruno Giussani: Markus, I think that we should fly it once more.
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.




Good morning.
I've come here to share with you an experiment
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.

Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,
what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,
their independence, and their status in the family.
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
And the irony is that they don't need to be.
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.
If we add to that the many of us here now
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
a staggering 200 million people.
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence
about 30 years back
as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.
He started this with no money.
He had to mortgage all his life savings
to make a bank loan.
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
as a hub-and-spoke model.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals
in other parts of the country
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
The last three decades,
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,
a vast majority of them for the poor people.
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
maybe see about 6,000 patients,
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
lots of telemedicine consultations,
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
put in place by Dr. V.,
a value system, an efficient delivery process,
and fostering the culture of innovation.

Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
you seem to be one with him.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
An implicit faith in you
and then you respond to it.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.

This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization
and systems that support it.
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.
They feel they can train people all over the world,
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,
to produce a product in the same way
and deliver it in the same manner
in hundreds of places.
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,
and none of it made any sense to us.
He wanted to create a franchise,
a mechanism of delivery of eye care
with the efficiency of McDonald's.
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,
techniques, methods, all in the same way,
and make it available in every corner of the world.
The problem of blindness is gone.
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,
as American or African,
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed
when we designed the delivery systems.
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
we are talking of millions of people,
very little resource to deal with it,
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,
and then engage with them as a partner,
and here is one such event.
Here a community camp just organized
by the community themselves,
where they find a place, organize volunteers,
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
and then determine what further testing should be done,
and then those tests are done by technicians
who check for glasses,
or check for glaucoma.
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,
and then prescribes a line of treatment,
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
and that's very important because I think glasses,
in addition to helping people see,
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes
and those who require surgery, are counseled,
and then there are buses waiting,
which will transport them to the base hospital.
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,
many people like this would probably never get services,
and certainly not when they most need it.
They receive surgery the following day,
and then they will stay for a day or two,
and then they are put back on the buses
to be taken back to where they came from,
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.

And this happens several thousand times each year.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
very efficient process,
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,
and then, to our dismay,
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
So we had to do something different,
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
These are truly paperless offices
with completely electronic medical records and so on.
They receive comprehensive eye exams.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
which is over 50,000 people.
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which
we can really penetrate into the market
and reach everyone who needs it,
and in this process of using technology, make sure
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
And how much will they pay for this?
We fixed the pricing, taking into account
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.

The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech
or more advanced treatment and care?
We designed a van with a VSAT,
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital
where it is diagnosed,
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
and then this happens as a way of
bridging the technology competence.
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,
because it focused on the non-customer,
and then by reaching the unreached,
we're able to significantly grow the market.
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently
when you have very few ophthalmologists?
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
and then you see on the other side,
another patient is getting ready.
So, as they finish the surgery,
they just swing the microscope over,
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
And then to support the surgeon,
we require a certain workforce.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
With the result we have very high productivity,
very high quality at very, very low cost.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was
the productivity of our staff was
significantly higher than anyone else.

This is a very busy table,
but what this really is conveying is that,
when it comes to quality, we have put in
very good quality-assurance systems.
As a result, our complications are significantly lower
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.

So the final part of the puzzle is,
how do you make all this work financially,
especially when the people can't pay for it?
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
nothing more, and often much less.
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
what you have as a surplus.
The result has been, over the years,
the expenditure has increased with volumes.
The revenues increase at a higher level,
giving us a healthy margin
while you're treating a large number of people for free.
I think in absolute terms,
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.

But this really requires going beyond what we do,
or what we have done,
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
We created competition for ourselves,
and then we made eye care affordable
by making low-cost consumables.
We proactively and systematically
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,
in the second year after our consultation,
are double their output
and then achieve financial recovery as well.
The other part was how do you address
this increase in cost of technology?
There was a time when we failed to negotiate
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
so we set up a manufacturing unit.
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,
or is it just India or developing countries?
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
of the volume of what the UK does,
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
And we do about 300,000.
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists
against the 70 trained by them,
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
So we're really comparing apples to apples.
We looked at cost.


So, I think it is simple to say
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I think there is more to it.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
Maybe there is --
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
or regulations, their defensive practice.
So, I think decoding this can probably bring
answers to most developed countries
including the U.S., and maybe
Obama's ratings can go up again.

Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,
in conditions where the problem is very large,
which cuts across all economic strata,
where we have a good solution,
I think the process I described,
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,
can give an answer,
and there are many which fit this paradigm.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play,
but I think probably one of the most challenging things
is on the softer side.
Now, how do you create compassion?
Now, how do you make people own the problem,
want to do something about it?
There are a bit harder issues.
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,
we identify with all that is in the world
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
TR: Thank you very much.

I am a Ph.D. student
and that means I have a question:
how can we make digital content graspable?
Because you see,
on the one hand, there is the digital world
and no question, many things are happening there right now.
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there --
it's virtual.
On the other hand, we humans,
we live in a physical world.
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
So the question is: how do we get the stuff over
from the digital into the physical?
That's my question.
If you look at the iPhone with its touch
and the Wii with its bodily activity,
you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
The question is: what's next?
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.
The first one is mass.
As humans, we are sensitive
to where an object in our hand is heavy.
So, could we use that in mobile phones?
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
It is a mobile phone-shaped box
that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,
and you can feel where it's heavy.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
For example, we can augment digital content
with physical mass.
So you move around the content on a display,
but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
Another thing it's good for is navigation --
it can guide you around in a city.
It can tell you by its weight,
Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here.
And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time;
you have your eyes free to see the city.
Now, mass is the first thing;
the second thing, that's shape.
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands.
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages --
well, they could be thin, right --
but if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --
it's thick. 
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,
and this one can change its shape.
We can play with the shape itself.
For example, it can be thin in your pocket,
which we of course want it to be;
but then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.
It's like tapered to the downside.
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie
or use as an alarm clock, it stands.
It's fairly simple.
Another thing is,
sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone,
they are bigger than the phone itself.
So in that case -- like here, there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen --
the shape of the phone could tell you,
Okay, off the screen right here, there is more content.
You can't see it, but it's there."
And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge.
The shape is the second thing.
The third thing operates on a different level.
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,
and that's great.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box,
but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat,
and it feels very organic.

And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
Oh now, missed call, a new call,
new girlfriend maybe --
very exciting. 
How do we calm it down?
You give it a pat behind the ears,
and everything is all right again.
So, that's very intuitive, and that's what we want.
So, what we have seen are three ways
to make the digital graspable for us.
And I think making it physical
is a good way to do that.
What's behind that is a postulation,
namely that not
humans should get much more technical in the future;
rather than that,
technology, a bit more human.

Because of what I'm about to say,
I really should establish my green credentials.
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
the natural resources of my country,
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
And I've stuck to that.
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
so it's the same now, 30 years later,
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,
called Whole Earth Discipline.
The dominant demographic event of our time
is this screamingly rapid urbanization
that we have going on.
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,
and that's mostly in the developing world,
where that's happening.
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
by the size of cities.
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
and nine times bigger.
It's qualitatively different.
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power
similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
In other words, the rise of the West,
dramatic as it was, is over.
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
1.3 million people a week coming to town,
decade after decade.
What's really going on?
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.
People are following opportunity into town.
And this is why.
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,
and it's because I never lived in one.

Because in town --
this is the bustling squatter city
of Kibera, near Nairobi --
they see action. They see opportunity.
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in
back in the subsistence farm.
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.
There is plenty going on.
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
The aggregate numbers now
are that basically squatters,
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,
which means they're building the world --
personally, one by one, family by family,
clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
They even build their own infrastructure.
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
And then gradually gentrifies.
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,
it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
These people are valuable as a group.
And that's how they work.
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,
Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing.
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.
Famine mostly is a rural event now.
There are things they care about.
And this is where we can help.
And the nations they're in can help.
And they are helping each other solve these issues.
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.
You look at that lane on the right.
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
The answer is, "Everything."
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.
It's much more interactive.
And the scale is terrific.
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
These are people busy getting out of poverty
just as fast as they can.
They're helping each other do it.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing,
the informal economy.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
Furthermore, people in the informal economy,
the gray economy --
as time goes by,
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,
or they can join the legitimate world.
We should be able to make that choice
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
There's all kinds of activity.
In Dharavi the slum performs not only
a lot of services for itself,
but it performs services for the city at large.
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers
to a private, tiny, unofficial school.
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things.
So one thing slammed up against another,
such as in Sao Paulo here.
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,
is by slamming things together.
In this case, supply right next to demand.
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards
that live in this lively part of town on the left
walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.
Proximity is amazing.
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.
Connectivity between the city and the country
is what's going to keep the country good,
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.
This is what makes cities --

this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster
of subsistence farms, and head to town.
And when they're gone the natural environment
starts to come back very rapidly.
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
to send food to the new growing markets in town.
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.
More than half.
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
Another billion is expected.
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
And that will determine a lot of how we function.
Now, for us environmentalists,
maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
People get into town.
The immediately have fewer children.
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of
coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,
and the birthrate goes down radically.
Very interesting side effect here,
here's a slide from Phillip Longman.
Shows what is happening.
As we have more and more old people, like me,
and fewer and fewer babies.
And they are regionally separated.
What you're getting is a world which is
old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,
in the north.
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,
doing new things, in the south.
Where do you think the action is going to be?
Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
than we think, faster than we think.
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,
full of runaway positive feedbacks,
hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
Here's just a few samples.
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all
the surprises are going to be bad ones.
From your standpoint this means
a great increase in climate refugees
over the coming decades,
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars
and chaos wars,
as we're seeing in Darfur.
That's what drought does.
It brings carrying capacity down,
and there's not enough carrying capacity
to support the people. And then you're in trouble.
Shift to the power situation.
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
or a city planet.
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
coal, some gas,
nuclear and hydro.
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
And everyone will keep burning it
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.
So with hydro maxed out,
coal and lose the climate,
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
and maybe save the climate.
And if we can eventually get good solar in space,
that also could help.
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world
in the villages and in the cities.
So, between coal and nuclear,
compare their waste products.
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
the amount of waste that would be added up
would fit in a Coke can.
Whereas a coal-burning plant,
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
each car having 100 tons.
And it puts 18 thousand tons
of carbon dioxide in the air.
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
of these various energy forms,
nuclear is about even with solar and wind,
and ahead of solar --
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.
And does nuclear really compete with coal?
Just ask the coal miners in Australia.
That's where you see some of the source,
not from my fellow environmentalists,
but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
Well the good news is that
the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,
is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.
This is good for the atmosphere.
It's good for their prosperity.
I want to point out one interesting thing,
which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,
and good things like that.
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,
might serve even better.
The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
And they're selling these floating reactors,
only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,
25 million watts,
and you compare it to the standard big iron
of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,
which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
Here's another American design that came out
of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
They're typically buried in the ground.
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
In terms of proliferation,
nuclear energy has done more
to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
20 percent of electricity
in this room is probably nuclear.
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,
that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
And I was glad to see that president Obama
supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy
when he spoke in Prague the other week.
One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,
in my view, as a biologist,
have no reason to be controversial.
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,
have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
Despite their best efforts,
genetically engineered crops are the most
rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,
which leaves the soil in place,
getting healthier from year to year --
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil
into the atmosphere.
They reduce pesticide use.
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your
agricultural area be smaller,
and therefore more wild area is freed up.
By the way, this map from 2006
is out of date because it shows Africa
still under the thumb of Greenpeace,
and Friends of the Earth from Europe,
and they're finally getting out from under that.
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.
This is a moral issue.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics
met on this issue twice in great detail
and said it is a moral imperative
to make genetically engineered crops readily available.
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,
especially in government circles,
though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,
but it will be on your plate --
not this year but pretty soon,
because some harsh realizations are coming along.
This is a list of them.
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
There will be events,
like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,
which happened a while back.
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
Like wars over water,
such as in the Indus.
And as those events keep happening
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
But there's this little problem with geoengineering:
what body is going to decide
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
Because everybody is downstream,
downwind of whatever is done.
And if we just taboo it completely
we could lose civilization.
But if we just say "OK,
China, you're worried, you go ahead.
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
I should say, it is more practical than people think.
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
This one came from the sulfur dioxide
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --
cooled the earth by half a degree.
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,
that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs
who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere
would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.
That's nothing, compared to all of the other
things we may be trying to do about energy.
Just to run by another one:
this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,
by atomizing seawater;
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
A nice one, because it can happen
lots of little ways in lots of little places,
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians
who made good agricultural soil
by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon
while it's improving the soil.
So here is where we are.
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen
calls our geological era the Anthropocene,
the human-dominated era. We are stuck
with its obligations.
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,
We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it.
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline
are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."
Thank you.

I just did something I've never done before.
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
Now I'm not a scientist,
but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team
from the University of South Florida
who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil
in the Gulf of Mexico.
This is the boat we were on, by the way.
The scientists I was with
were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --
the birds, the turtles,
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
They're looking at the really little stuff
that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
And what they're finding
is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants
can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,
which is very bad news,
because so much life depends on it.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back
about how 75 percent of that oil
sort of magically disappeared
and we didn't have to worry about it,
this disaster is still unfolding.
It's still working its way up the food chain.
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
Rachel Carson --
the godmother of modern environmentalism --
warned us about this very thing
back in 1962.
She pointed out that the "control men" --
as she called them --
who carpet-bombed towns and fields
with toxic insecticides like DDT,
were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,
not the birds.
But they forgot this:
the fact that birds dine on grubs,
that robins eat lots of worms
now saturated with DDT.
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,
songbirds died en masse,
towns fell silent.
Thus the title "Silent Spring."
I've been trying to pinpoint
what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,
because I'm Canadian,
and I can draw no ancestral ties.
And I think what it is
is I don't think we have fully come to terms
with the meaning of this disaster,
with what it meant to witness a hole
ripped in our world,
with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth
gush forth on live TV,
24 hours a day,
for months.
After telling ourselves for so long
that our tools and technology can control nature,
suddenly we were face-to-face
with our weakness,
with our lack of control,
as the oil burst out
of every attempt to contain it --
top hats, "top kills"
and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --
the bright idea
of firing old tires and golf balls
down that hole in the world.
But even more striking
than the ferocious power emanating from that well
was the recklessness
with which that power was unleashed --
the carelessness, the lack of planning
that characterized the operation
from drilling to clean-up.
If there is one thing
BP's watery improv act made clear,
it is that, as a culture,
we have become far too willing to gamble
with things that are precious
and irreplaceable,
and to do so without a back-up plan,
without an exit strategy.
And BP was hardly
our first experience of this in recent years.
Our leaders barrel into wars,
telling themselves happy stories
about cakewalks and welcome parades.
Then, it is years of deadly damage control,
Frankensteins of sieges and surges
and counter-insurgencies,
and once again, no exit strategy.
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim
to similar overconfidence,
convincing themselves that the latest bubble
is a new kind of market --
the kind that never goes down.
And when it inevitably does,
the best and the brightest
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --
in this case, throwing massive amounts
of much-needed public money
down a very different kind of hole.
As with BP, the hole does get plugged,
at least temporarily,
but not before
exacting a tremendous price.
We have to figure out
why we keep letting this happen,
because we are in the midst
of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --
deciding what to do, or not to do,
about climate change.
Now as you know,
a great deal of time is spent,
in this country and around the world,
inside the climate debate,
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists
are all wrong?"
Now a far more relevant question --
as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --
is, "What if those scientists are right?"
Given the stakes, the climate crisis
clearly calls for us to act
based on the precautionary principle --
the theory that holds
that when human health and the environment
are significantly at risk
and when the potential damage is irreversible,
we cannot afford to wait
for perfect scientific certainty.
Better to err on the side of caution.
More overt, the burden of proving
that a practice is safe
should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,
but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
But climate policy in the wealthy world --
to the extent that such a thing exists --
is not based on precaution,
but rather on cost-benefit analysis --
finding the course of action that economists believe
will have the least impact
on our GDP.
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,
what can we do as quickly as possible
to avoid potential catastrophe,
we ask bizarre questions like this:
What is the latest possible moment we can wait
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
Can we put this off till 2020,
2030, 2050?"
Or we ask,
How much hotter can we let the planet get
and still survive?
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --
where we're currently going --
four degrees Celsius?"
And by the way,
the assumption that we can safely control
the Earth's awesomely complex climate system
as if it had a thermostat,
making the planet not too hot, not too cold,
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --
this is pure fantasy,
and it's not coming from the climate scientists.
It's coming from the economists
imposing their mechanistic thinking
on the science.
The fact is that we simply don't know
when the warming that we create
will be utterly overwhelmed
by feedback loops.
So once again,
why do we take these crazy risks
with the precious?
A range of explanations
may be popping into your mind by now,
like "greed."
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
because taking big risks, as we all know,
pays a lot of money.
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness
is hubris.
And greed and hubris
are intimately intertwined
when it comes to recklessness.
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker
taking home 100 times more
than a brain surgeon,
then you need a narrative,
you need a story
that makes that disparity okay.
And you actually don't have a lot of options.
You're either an incredibly good scammer,
and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --
or you're some kind of boy genius,
the likes of which the world has never seen.
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --
are going to make you vastly overconfident
and therefore more prone
to taking even bigger risks in the future.
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,
had a plaque on his desk
inscribed with this inspirational slogan:
What would you attempt to do
if you knew you could not fail?"
Now this is actually a popular plaque,
and this is a crowd of overachievers,
so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
Don't feel ashamed.
Putting fear of failure out of your mind
can be a very good thing
if you're training for a triathlon
or preparing to give a TEDTalk,
but personally, I think people with the power
to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology
would do better having
a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,
because -- maybe not that one in particular --
but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure
all of the time.
So we have greed,
we've got overconfidence/hubris,
but since we're here at TEDWomen,
let's consider one other factor
that could be contributing in some small way
to societal recklessness.
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,
but studies do show that, as investors,
women are much less prone
to taking reckless risks than men,
precisely because, as we've already heard,
women tend not to suffer from overconfidence
in the same way that men do.
So it turns out
that being paid less and praised less
has its upsides --
for society at least.
The flipside of this
is that constantly being told
that you are gifted, chosen
and born to rule
has distinct societal downsides.
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --
brings us closer, I think,
to the root of our collective recklessness.
Because none of us -- at least in the global North --
neither men nor women,
are fully exempt from this message.
Here's what I'm talking about.
Whether we actively believe them
or consciously reject them,
our culture remains in the grips
of certain archetypal stories
about our supremacy
over others and over nature --
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier
and the conquering pioneer,
the narrative of manifest destiny,
the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
And just when you think these stories are fading into history,
and that we've gotten over them,
they pop up in the strangest places.
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement
outside the women's washroom
in the Kansas City airport.
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,
and yes, it really does say,
Slap Mother Nature in the face.
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --
that's just a bonus.
I'm showing it because --
they're not a sponsor, are they? --
because, in its own way,
this is a crass version
of our founding story.
We slapped Mother Nature around and won,
and we always win,
because dominating nature is our destiny.
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
There's another one, equally important,
about how that very same Mother Nature
is so nurturing and so resilient
that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.
The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it
is tiny in relation to the total water volume."
In other words, the ocean is big;
she can take it.
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness
that makes it possible
to take the reckless risks that we do.
Because this is our real master-narrative:
however much we mess up,
there will always be more --
more water, more land,
more untapped resources.
A new bubble will replace the old one.
A new technology will come along
to fix the messes we made with the last one.
In a way, that is the story
of the settling of the Americas,
the supposedly inexhaustible frontier
to which Europeans escaped.
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,
because it was the wealth from this land
that gave birth to our economic system,
one that cannot survive without perpetual growth
and an unending supply
of new frontiers.
Now the problem is
that the story was always a lie.
The Earth always did have limits.
They were just beyond our sights.
And now we are hitting those limits
on multiple fronts.
I believe that we know this,
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
Not only do we continue to tell and retell
the same tired stories,
but we are now doing so
with a frenzy and a fury
that, frankly, verges on camp.
How else to explain the cultural space
occupied by Sarah Palin?
Now on the one hand,
exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"
because God put those resources into the ground
in order for us to exploit them,
and on the other, glorying in the wilderness
of Alaska's untouched beauty
on her hit reality TV show.
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
Ignore those creeping fears
that we have finally hit the wall.
There are still no limits.
There will always be another frontier.
So stop worrying and keep shopping.
Now, would that this were just about
Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
In environmental circles,
we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,
we are continuing with business as usual.
This assessment, unfortunately,
is far too optimistic.
The truth is that we have already exhausted
so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels
that we have already entered
a far riskier business era,
the era of extreme energy.
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,
including the icy Arctic seas,
where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas
and massive strip-mining operations for coal,
the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
I'm always surprised by how little
people outside of Canada
know about the Alberta Tar Sands,
which this year are projected to become
the number one source of imported oil
to the United States.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,
because I believe it speaks to recklessness
and the path we're on
like little else.
So this is where the tar sands live,
under one of the last magnificent
Boreal forests.
The oil is not liquid.
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
Tar sand's oil is solid,
mixed in with the soil.
So to get at it,
you first have to get rid of the trees.
Then, you rip off the topsoil
and get at that oily sand.
The process requires a huge amount of water,
which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
That's very bad news for local indigenous people
living downstream
who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
Now looking at these images,
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,
which can already be seen from space
and could grow to an area the size of England.
I find it helps actually
to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,
the largest ever built.
That's a person down there by the wheel.
My point is that
this is not oil drilling.
It's not even mining.
It is terrestrial skinning.
Vast, vivid landscapes
are being gutted,
left monochromatic gray.
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned
this would be an abomination
if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
But the truth is that, on average,
turning that gunk into crude oil
produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution
than it does to produce conventional oil
in Canada.
How else to describe this,
but as a form of mass insanity?
Just when we know we need to be learning
to live on the surface of our planet,
off the power of sun, wind and waves,
we are frantically digging
to get at the dirtiest,
highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
This is where our story of endless growth
has taken us,
to this black hole at the center of my country --
a place of such planetary pain
that, like the BP gusher,
one can only stand to look at it for so long.
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,
this is how civilizations commit suicide,
by slamming their foot on the accelerator
at the exact moment
when they should be putting on the brakes.
The problem is that our master-narrative
has an answer for that too.
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved
just like in every Hollywood movie,
just like in the Rapture.
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
Now, you may have noticed
more and more headlines like these.
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,
is that, as the planet heats up,
we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
into the stratosphere
to reflect some of the sun's rays
back to space,
thereby cooling the planet.
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --
would put what is essentially a garden hose
18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,
suspended by balloons,
to spew sulfur dioxide.
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
The serious scientists involved in this research
all stress that these techniques
are entirely untested.
They don't know if they'll work,
and they have no idea
what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering
is being greeted in some circles,
particularly media circles,
with a relief tinged with euphoria.
An escape hatch has been reached.
A new frontier has been found.
Most importantly,
we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
You see, for some people,
their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
We badly need some new stories.
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes
willing to take different kinds of risks --
risks that confront recklessness head on,
that put the precautionary principle into practice,
even if that means through direct action --
like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,
blocking dirty power plants
or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
We need stories
that replace that linear narrative of endless growth
with circular narratives
that remind us
that what goes around comes around.
That this is our only home.
There is no escape hatch.
Call it karma, call it physics,
action and reaction, call it precaution --
the principle that reminds us
that life is too precious to be risked
for any profit.
Thank you.

Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
it's something we just kind of learned for this,
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
Nice show. Man, that was good!
DH: Thank you.
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
You actually just did that. 
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...
DH: All right, let's show them something special.
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props
he has invented and working on.
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,
right after I saw another juggler do it.
BF: Shut up. 
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.


Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper
but it certainly slows it down.
BF: Oh yeah, it does. 
BF: Oh, Daniel.

DH: One more? 
Perfect. 
Perfect. 
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.

I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control
over three with my right hand. 
BF: Also three with his left.
DH: Perfect.

And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try
or should I miss once on purpose? 
BF: First try? Once on purpose?

DH: How about if I try first and then decide?
BF: Good idea.  Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.
 
DH: He's looking at me.
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. 
Oh, good. All right.
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,
it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous
with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
And then we thought, "How stupid."
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?
BF: I think that's the next session.
DH: Next session?
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.
DH: Please stand up, Richard. 
Oh, sorry. 
DH: Now Richard, please ... 
BF: OK, sorry.
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?
BF: Sure.
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,
the things that have happened to me --
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.

BF: No, come stay up with him.
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.
It's kind of neat. OK.

DH: Wow, you've been working out.
BF: No, shut up!

Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.
OK, here we go.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
There you go.

OK.
OK, hold on.
RW: Hmmm.

DH: First one.
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.

DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?

What happened there?
BF: I think we were just outside.
DH: I don't get it. 

DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.  
DH: One more, one more.
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.
RW: Do I get to hold them?
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?

BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.



One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.

Could you just push that?

DH: Wow! Boy!
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.

DH: Let's jump this way, though.
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...

DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.
DH: True. Barry ...
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.
DH: Leap over my shoulder.
BF: Up and over his shoulders.
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...

Still juggling. 
Impossible, you say?
BF: Incredible, you say?
DH: Why bother, you say?
BF: Here we go.
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.
DH: I think so, that's right.
Even the pencil.
BF: He invented the pencil.
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember
it took us over 10 years to perfect.
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove --
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal
up onto the stage?

Or a virgin for a sacrifice?
BF: Anything?
DH: Where's Gloria? 
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.
BF: Over the top, over the top.
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?
BF: Yeah, it's all right.
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.
DH: Everything up here's OK?
BF: Yeah.
DH: Then here we go.
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you
point that a little more directly
into my eyeballs? Is that possible?  I can still see a little.
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.
We went too far. 
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
DH: May we have our jumping music please? 
May we have it a bit louder?

BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.
BF: We're going on.
DH: All right, we'll try again.
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.
DH: Whenever you're ready.
BF: There we go!

All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Somebody dance! Come on!

Wow, wow, OK, stop.
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. 
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.
DH: The French judge ...
BF: One more quick thing.
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.

BF: Well, you know ...
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read
that we've won two world juggling championships.
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions
for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
We're going to show you right now
an excerpt from a routine that we used
to wipe out the other juggling team competition.
DH: That's right.
BF: Good.
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.

BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.
And look, it has a twin!
BF: Shut up. 
DH: There's still one more by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. 
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.
BF: Nice.
DH: I got that --
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.
BF: Nice.
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.

DH: How about that? I'll do it again.
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.
And it's awfully windy over there.
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
Oh, look how it lies there.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?

You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.
Too much Olympics.
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
What gem of knowledge?
What pearl of wisdom?
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
Is that your final answer?
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.
DH: I do, I do.
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.
DH: We will juggle seven.
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.
BF: Yes.
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.
Put your tongue away, Barry.
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.

DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
Because now, to make this twice as difficult,
we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...
BF: Seven-club juggling.
DH: ... to back.
BF: Thank you, that's it.
BF: Thank you guys!
DH: Thank you very much!
I have a big impact on the planet
to travel here by plane.
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;
that is the weight of two elephants.
I came here to speak about ecology,
and I emitted as much CO2
as a Frenchman in one year.
So what do I have to do?
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?

I have to do my carbon offset in another way,
like I do every time.

In fact my work is to show
our impact on our planet.
I'm going to show you some examples
of the last pictures I've done
in the last year.
Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.
You know the problem;
we don't want to believe what we know.
In Alberta people work nonstop,
24 hours by seven
to extract as much oil
as they can.
We know about the end of oil.
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.
But we use three times more oil
than we find every year.
We don't want to believe what we know.
Deny.
Coral reef in New Caledonia.
100 percent of the coral
may be wiped out before 2050
because of global warming.
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,
and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.
North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.
The thickness of the Arctic
decreased more than 40 percent
since 1960.
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.
Sad picture.
It lost 80 percent of its ice.
According to scientists,
in 100 years
all the mountain glacier will be gone.
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.
Like Al Gore told you,
two billion people live on the water
from the glacier of Himalaya.
Return of fish men.
One fifth of human kind
depend on fish to live.
Today now 70 percent
of the fish stock are over-exploited.
According to FAO,
if we don't change our system of fishing
the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
We don't want to believe what we know.
The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.
One human of six
have not enough to eat in the world.
One billion people have not enough to eat.
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.
Here in America,
90 percent of the corn cultivated
is used to feed animals or to do oil.
Palm tree plantation in Borneo.
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.
Refugee camp in Darfur.
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.
According to the U.N.,
we speak about 250 million refugees
in 2050.
I always show my pictures in the street.
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
But how to understand the world
without the voice of people?
Landscape was not enough.
It was obvious to me to do another work.
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.
I sent around the world six cameramen
asking the same question,
the same crucial question,
about life.
We have done five thousand interviews.
I'm going to show you this.
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.
Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,
this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...
Woman: You're asking me a hard question.
Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?
Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... 
Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, 
Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. 
Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.
10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.
11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?
12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq
and speak to the people,
I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet
when we were taking her sons.
I feel ashamed.
And I feel humbled
by their strength.
And I will forever feel a need
to make reparations to Iraq.
Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.
My family ... What can I say?
At the moment, my family is very poor,
my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more
and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
Thank you.
Thank you for having fed me and raised me,
and for making my life of today. Thank you.
13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,
I've done more in life being in a chair
than out of a chair.
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.
After many people said I couldn't do that.
And I think that comes from connecting with nature,
connecting with the energy of life,
because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --
spiritually, mentally or physically.
I got the easy part.
14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.
You come from elsewhere.
You don't know me. I don't know you.
We talk without lying.
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things
and we become friends.
How can we make it all by ourselves?

YAB: You can also go to the website,
answer -- respond to the questions also.
Forty crucial questions.
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
For the last three years,
I was shooting the earth for the movie.
The name of the movie is "Home" --
Maison.
It is about the state of the planet.
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.
Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
These plants, several hundred million years old.
And we humans have been walking upright
for only 200 thousand years.
We've managed to adapt,
and have conquered the whole planet.
For generations, we've been raising our children,
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
For the past 30 years
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers
from high up in the sky.
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
We depend on water,
forests,
deserts,
oceans.
Fishing,
breeding,
farming
are still the world's foremost human occupations.
And what binds us together
is far greater than what divides us.
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --
the same wish to rise above ourselves,
and become better.
And yet we carry on raising walls
to keep us apart.
Today our greatest battle
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
In less than 50 years
we've altered it more thoroughly
than in the entire history of mankind.
Half of the world's forests have vanished.
Water resources are running low.
Intensive farming is depleting soils.
Our energy sources are not sustainable.
The climate is changing.
We are endangering ourselves.
We're only trying to improve our lives.
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.
We haven't yet understood
that we're going at a much faster pace
than the planet can sustain.
We know that solutions are available today.
We all have the power to change this trend
for the better.
So what are we waiting for?

YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
But it is not a normal movie.
The film is going to be distributed free.
This film has no copyright.
On the five of June,
the environment day,
everybody can download the movie on Internet.
The film is given for free
to the distributor for TV and theater
to show it the fifth of June.
There is no business on this movie.
It is also available for school,
cities, NGOs and you.
We have to believe what we know.
Let me tell you something.
It's too late to be pessimistic --
really too late.
We have all a part of the solutions.
To finish,
I would like to welcome
the 4,700th baby
born since the beginning of this talk.
Merci beaucoup. I love you.

So I am a pediatric cancer doctor
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,
I didn't bring a human brain,
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
And bone marrow is actually what we use
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma
and some other diseases.
So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,
who is a volunteer donor.
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life
of a child with leukemia.
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,
and another doctor across from me.
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,
you know, not too big.
And the way we do this is we basically
place this through the soft tissue,
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
each time, with a syringe.
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
About 200 times usually.
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
let alone Bob,
whose rear end looks something more like this,
like Swiss cheese.
So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
This is it.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
Our standard see-through patient.
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
And we have a flexible, powered catheter
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
No robots required.
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,
and do this harvest as an outpatient.
So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.
And played around with this a little bit.
And our team members developed this technology.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells
than the standard approach done on the same patient.
So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.
You all know about embryonic stem cells.
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy
for over 40 years.
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases
such as heart disease, vascular disease,
orthopedics, tissue engineering,
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's
and diabetes.
We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,
which translates to better outcomes.
It may encourage more people to sign up to be
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.
It may even enable you to bank
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,
to use in the future should you need it.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our
bone marrow transplant survivors,
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
Hopefully this technology will let us
have more of these survivors in the future.
Thanks.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the human genome.

Chromosome one, top left.
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes.
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome;
men have the X
and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
So if you zoom in on this genome,
then what you see, of course, is this double helix structure --
the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters,
or we call them bases, right:
A, C, G and T.
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
Is that a big number?
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers.
But in fact, if I were to place one base
on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen,
we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
So it's really quite big.
And perhaps because of its size,
a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes --
decided they would want to sequence it.

And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later,
the genome was sequenced and published.
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
That was all done on a machine that looks like this.
It costs about a dollar for each base --
a very slow way of doing it.
Well folks, I'm here to tell you
that the world has completely changed
and none of you know about it.
So now what we do is we take a genome,
we make maybe 50 copies of it,
we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads,
and then we sequence them, massively parallel.
And then we bring that into software,
and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is.
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like,
the Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right.
One run on one of these machines:
200 gigabases in a week.
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer,
and there's no sign of this pace slowing.
So the price of a base, to sequence a base,
has fallen 100 million times.
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998,
waiting until 2011,
and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.

World population,
PC placements,
the archive of all the medical literature,
Moore's law,
the old way of sequencing, and here's all the new stuff.
Guys, this is a log scale;
you don't typically see lines that go up like that.
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes
is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed.
This is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple
year over year for the foreseeable future.
In fact, there's one lab in particular
that represents 20 percent of all that capacity.
It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.
What does this mean for medicine?
So a woman is age 37.
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
She is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
She goes home.
Two years later, she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer.
Unfortunately, treated again with surgery and chemotherapy.
She comes back three years later at age 42
with more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
Six months later,
she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
So first, the way in which this woman was treated, in as little as 10 years,
will look like bloodletting.
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson,
at the Genome Institute at Washington University,
who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
And he sequenced, he took skin cells, healthy skin,
and cancerous bone marrow,
and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them
in a couple of weeks, no big deal.
And then he compared those two genomes in software,
and what he found, among other things,
was a deletion, a 2,000-base deletion
across three billion bases
in a particular gene called TP53.
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene,
you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
So unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman,
but it does have severe, profound if you will,
implications to her family.
I mean, if they have the same mutation,
and they get this genetic test, and they understand it,
then they can go and get regular screens, and they can catch cancer early
and potentially live a significantly longer life.
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins,
diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
Their mom is a very brave woman
who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up,
and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching,
she was able to convince the medical community
that, in fact, they had something else.
What they had was dopa-responsive dystonia.
And so they were given L-Dopa,
and their symptoms did improve,
but they weren't totally asymptomatic.
Significant problems remained.
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery,
who was lucky enough to be the CIO
of a company called Life Technologies.
They're one of the two companies
that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools.
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced.
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR,
which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug,
and they're effectively normal now.
Guys, this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing.
And at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.
Today it's $10,000. Next year it's $1,000.
The year after it's $100, give or take a year.
That's how fast this is moving.
So here's little Nick --
likes Batman and squirt guns.
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital
with this distended belly like a famine victim.
And it's not that he's not eating,
it's that when he eats, his intestine basically opens up
and feces spill out into his gut.
So a hundred surgeries later,
he looks at his mom and says, "Mom,
please pray for me. I'm in so much pain."
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics
and he has no idea what's going on,
but he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."
And what they find is a single-point mutation
in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction
to what's going on to the food essentially,
and that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death.
But the gene that regulates that down is broken.
And so this informs, among other things, of course,
a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
And after nine months of grueling recovery,
he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.

The prospect of using the genome
as a universal diagnostic
is upon us today.
Today, it's here.
And what it means for all of us
is that everybody in this room could live an extra five, 10, 20 years
just because of this one thing.
Which is a fantastic story,
unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet
and our ability to keep up food production.
So it turns out
that the very same technology
is also being used to grow new lines
of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops
that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood,
of pests and pesticides.
Now look, as long as we continue to increase the population,
we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods,
and that's the only position that I'll take today.
Unless there's anybody in the audience
that would like to volunteer to stop eating?
None, not one.
This is a typewriter,
a staple of every desktop for decades.
And in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
And then more general versions of word processors came about.
But ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet
and the connection of all these computers
that fundamentally changed everything.
And suddenly we had Netscape, and we had Yahoo
and we had, indeed, the entire dotcom bubble.

Not to worry though,
that was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook
and, indeed, angry birds.

Look, this is where we are today.
This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.
So what I'd like you to consider is:
What does it mean
when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome,
but they connect to genomes all across the planet?
So I just recently had to buy life insurance.
And I was required to answer:
A. I have never had a genetic test, B. I've had one, here you go,
and C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
Thankfully, I was able to answer A,
and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening.
But what would have happened if I had said C?
Consumer applications for genomics, they will flourish.
Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible
with your girlfriend? Sure.
DNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.

Personalized genomic massage anyone?
There's already a lab today
that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,
the so-called cheating gene.
So anybody who's here today with your significant other,
just turn over to them and swab their mouth,
send it to the lab and you'll know for sure.

Do you really want to elect a president
whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
Now think of it, it's 2016
and the leading candidate releases
not only her four years of back tax returns,
but also her personal genome.
And it looks really good.
And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same.
Do you think that's not going to happen?
Do you think it would have helped John McCain?

How many people in the audience
have the last name Resnick like me? Raise your hand.
Anybody? Nobody.
Typically, there's one or two.
So my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
They all hated each other.
And they all moved to different parts of the planet.
So it's likely
that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet, but I don't know.
But imagine if my genome were deidentified, sitting in software,
and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there,
and there was software that could compare these two
and make these associations.
Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.
And so imagine one more thing:
that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents,
Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?
And if we both say yes,
voila! Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn.

Now this is probably a good thing, right?
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on.
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.
How many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.
Okay, so experts think that one to three percent of you
are not actually the father of your child.

Look --

These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,
they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships
or the nature of our society -- at least not yet.
And like any new technology,
it's really in humanity's hands
to wield it for the betterment of mankind, or not.
And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in
and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
Thank you.

Whoa, dude. Check out those killer equations. Sweet. 
Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can
to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.
It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps.
These polyps are continually budding and branching
into genetically identical neighbors.
If we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral,
we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location
compared to his neighbors --
if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?
Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high,
he would tell us that our question was completely stupid.
These corals can be quite kind of mean, you see,
and I have surfing scars to prove that.
But this polyp would continue and tell us
that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.
That he was in all these other locations as well,
but experiencing them as separate individuals.
For a coral, branching into different copies
is the most natural thing in the world.
Unlike us, a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately
describes how our universe works.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching
into different possibilities, just like a coral.
It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around,
since we only ever get to experience one possibility.
This quantum weirdness was first described
by Erwin Schr?dinger and his cat.
The cat likes this version better.

In this setup, Schr?dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state
in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.

In the branch in which the sample radiates,
it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr?dinger is dead.
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.
These realities are experienced separately by each individual.
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.
This seems weird to us, because each of us
only experiences an individual existence,
and we don't get to see other branches.
It's as if each of us, like Schr?dinger here, are a kind of coral
branching into different possibilities.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us
this is how the world works at tiny scales.
It can be summed up in a single sentence:
Everything that can happen, does.
That's quantum mechanics.
But this does not mean everything happens.
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen
and what can't.
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry
and the interactions of elementary particles.
And things can happen only if these interactions
are perfectly balanced.
Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles,
what they are and how this balance works.
In this machine, a beam of protons and anti-protons
are accelerated to near the speed of light
and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.
This energy is immediately converted into a spray
of subatomic particles,
with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.
This enormous machine -- the large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Geneva --
has a circumference of 17 miles
and, when it's operating, draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.
We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.
These particles must have just as much mass and energy
as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton.
Any particles more massive than this energy limit
aren't produced, and remain invisible to us.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
It's going to push this energy limit seven times
beyond what's ever been done before,
so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
But before talking about what we might see,
let me describe the particles we already know of.
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.
Most of us are familiar with electrons.
A lot of people in this room make a good living
pushing them around.

But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino,
with no electric charge and a very tiny mass.
In contrast, the up-and-down quarks have very large masses,
and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons
inside atoms.
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties,
and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges.
These familiar particles also have less familiar
second and third generations, which have the same charges as the first
but have much higher masses.
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles.
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter
via particles called photons.
There is also a very weak force called, rather unimaginatively,
the weak force, that interacts
only with left-handed matter.
The strong force acts between quarks which carry
a different kind of charge, called color charge,
and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names --
they're his fault.
Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter
via its mass and spin.
The most important thing to understand here
is that there's a different kind of charge associated
with each of these forces.
These four different forces interact with matter
according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists,
is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider
is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see.
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility
towards the end of this talk.
Now, if we count up all these different particles
using their various spins and charges, there are 226.
That's a lot of particles to keep track of.
And it seems strange that nature would have
so many elementary particles.
But if we plot them out according to their charges,
some beautiful patterns emerge.
The most familiar charge is electric charge.
Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one,
and quarks have electric charges in thirds.
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined
to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one.
These particles also have anti-particles, which have opposite charges.
Now, it turns out the electric charge is actually
a combination of two other charges:
hypercharge and weak charge.
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge
and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space,
the electric charge is where these particles sit
along the vertical direction.
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter
according to their hypercharge and weak charge,
which make this pattern.
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model,
and it was put together back in 1967.
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge
and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass
and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.
It makes the weak force very weak
by giving the weak particles a large mass.
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction
in this diagram, the photons of electromagnetism remain massless
and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction
in this charge space.
So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described
by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space.
We can include the strong force by spreading out
its two charge directions and plotting the charges
of the force particles in quarks along these directions.
The charges of all known particles can be plotted
in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down
to two dimensions like this so we can see them.
Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance
along all four of these charge directions.
If a particle and an anti-particle collide, it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions.
At this point, anything can be created as long as it has
the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.
For example, this weak force particle and its anti-particle
can be created in a collision.
In further interactions, the charges must always balance.
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron
and an anti-neutrino,
and these three still add to zero total charge.
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty.
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions
to get a better look at the strong interaction,
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one,
interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one,
to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one.
And strong interactions are happening millions of times
each second in every atom of our bodies,
holding the atomic nuclei together.
But these four charges corresponding to three forces
are not the end of the story.
We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.
When we include these, each matter particle
has two different spin charges, spin-up and spin-down.
So they all split, and give a nice pattern
in six-dimensional charge space.
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions,
and see that it's quite pretty.
Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge
of how nature is built at the tiny scales
of these elementary particles.
This is what we know for certain.
Some of these particles are at the very limit
of what we've been able to reach with experiments.
From this pattern, we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales. The way the universe works
with these tiny scales is very beautiful.
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas
about things we don't know yet.
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone,
and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.
We want to find all the particles and forces
that make a complete picture of our universe.
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles
that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.
So there's an old idea in particle physics
that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric,
could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken --
similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern
to give electromagnetism.
In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces
with new charge directions.
When we introduce a new direction, we get to guess
what charges the particles have along this direction,
and then we can rotate it in with the others.
If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges
in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry
of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory
introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
When we look at this new unified pattern,
we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.
This is the way theories of unification work.
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns
that include the established pattern as a subset.
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence
of particles that have never been seen.
This unification model predicts the existence of these two
new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force,
only weaker.
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions
and consider an odd fact about the matter particles:
the second and third generations of matter
have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space
as the first generation.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.
However, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space,
then we can assign unique new charges to each particle.
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions,
and see what the whole pattern looks like.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now
related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually
part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry
of this very complex and beautiful shape.
One small part of this E8 shape can be used
to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,
explaining gravity.
Together with quantum mechanics, the geometry of this shape
could describe everything about how the universe works
at the tiniest scales.
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space
is exquisitely beautiful,
and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions
between these elementary particles, each of which
is just a facet of this complicated shape.
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns
contained in this one.
And with a particular rotation, we can look down through this pattern
in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
and see all the particles at once.
It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification,
we can see some holes where new particles are required
by this pattern.
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be,
two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles
should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle,
but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern,
giving us the full E8.
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure
in mathematics.
It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great
mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions
at the smallest scales imaginable.
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics
is not at all new.
In 1623, Galileo wrote this:
Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze,
is written in the language of mathematics.
Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures,
without which it is humanly impossible to understand
a single word of it;
without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
I believe this to be true, and I've tried
to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics
of particle physics using only triangles, circles
and other geometrical figures.
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff,
the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics
is pure, beautiful geometry.
Joined with quantum mechanics, this mathematics
describes our universe as a growing E8 coral,
with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways
according to a beautiful pattern.
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines
like the Large Hadron Collider, we may be able to see
whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern,
that will be very, very cool.
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern --
well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.
And, of course, bad for me personally.

Now how bad would that be?
Well, pretty bad.

But predicting how nature works is a very risky game.
This theory and others like it are long shots.
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas
probably won't end up being true about nature.
That's what doing theoretical physics is like:
there are a lot of wipeouts.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult
to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out.
But in science, if something isn't working, you have to
toss it out and try something else.
Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness
in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance
and perspective in life.
I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.

I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing --
my own three charge directions.

This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing,
I still know I've lived a good life.
And I try to live in beautiful places.
For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui,
a very beautiful place.
Now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents
how I managed to survive all that time without engaging
in anything resembling full-time employment.

I'm going to let you in on that secret.
This was a view from my home office on Maui.
And this is another, and another.
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views
are similar, but in slightly different places.
That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.

I've chosen a very unusual life.
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time
doing what I love.
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times,
but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places
and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out
with hyper-intelligent coral.
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people.
So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.
Thank you very much.

Chris Anderson: I probably understood two percent of that,
but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb.
Your theory of everything --
Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
CA: That's right. The reason it's got a few people
at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings
gravity and quantum theory together.
So are you saying that we should think of the universe,
at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are,
are somehow an E8 object of possibility?
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale,
or ...?
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds
to what we know about elementary particle physics --
that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.
And that's the one that I said we knew for certain.
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits
into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture.
And these patterns of points that I've shown for you
actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object
that would be warping and moving and dancing
over the space time that we experience.
And that would be what explains all these
elementary particles that we see.
CA: But a string theorist,
as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller
strings vibrating --
I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time,
it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves
is what particle we see. So it would be --
CA: The size of the E8 shape,
how does that relate to the electron?
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture.
Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
GL: Well, as far as we know electrons are point particles,
so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory
is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once.
And this is why I use the analogy to coral.
And in this way, the way that E8 comes in is
it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time.
And, as I said, the way the shape twists --
the directional along which way the shape is twisting
as it moves over this curved surface --
is what the elementary particles are, themselves.
So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves
as points and interact that way.
I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.

CA: It doesn't really matter.
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainly
want to understand more of this.
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.

Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
That is the call that chimpanzees make
before they go to sleep in the evening.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,
from one group of nests to the next.
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening
from where Zeray left off yesterday.
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind
through DNA genetic profiling.
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
It's kind of commonplace now,
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
And you can tell an awful lot
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,
from the shape of the muscle attachments,
something about the way they lived
from the various artifacts found with them.
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,
human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us
from that ancient, ancient past.
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,
you very often find people speculating about how early humans
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature,
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
As the brain becomes ever more complex
during evolution in different forms of animals,
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role
in an individual's life history.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
And we believe that it's in this way
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --
how these are passed from one generation to the next,
through observation, imitation and practice,
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And they swagger and they throw rocks.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,
precursors to love and true altruism.
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time
as we make even more observations.
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,
have helped -- more than anything else --
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
This is just one photograph from the air,
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,
and realized that outside the park, this forest,
which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken
along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,
that a question came to my mind.
How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi
and over the lake from Congo.
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives
of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,
almost desert-like land up in these mountains.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,
so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.
Most important of all, I believe,
is working with small groups of women,
providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
And we've got, as is the case around the world,
about 95 percent of all loans returned.
Empowering women, working with education,
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,
as women's education improves, family size drops.
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
And as a result of this program,
something's happening for conservation.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --
but when we began the TACARE program,
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,
asking what they were interested in.
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
They began to understand
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.
This is an area way outside the National Park,
stretching out into all these very degraded lands.
And as these villages have a better standard of life,
they are actually agreeing to put
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,
so that once again, as the trees grow back,
the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors
through which they can travel to interact --
as they must for genetic viability --
with other remnant groups outside the National Park.
So TACARE is a success.
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,
around other wilderness areas
which are faced with extreme population pressure.
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,
are major problems.
There is a great deal of poverty.
And when you get large numbers of people
living in land that is not that fertile,
particularly when you cut down trees,
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,
what's going to happen? Something's got to give.
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --
what are we doing to our planet?
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson
said that if every person on this planet
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,
we need three new planets.
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,
with this extraordinary brain,
capable of the kind of technology
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
The indigenous people around the world,
before they made a major decision,
used to sit around and ask themselves,
How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,
but the developed world --
major decisions involving millions of dollars,
and millions of people, are often based on,
How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?
And these decisions affect Africa.
As I began traveling around Africa
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,
talking in the United States, going to Asia.
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The earth is poisoning our foods.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues
that we're going to face in this century --
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,
industrial and household chemicals
that still are being sprayed around the world,
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
The mangroves are being cut down;
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
We've talked about the soil erosion.
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels
along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,
leading to climate change.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
All around the world climates are mixed up.
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
It's Africa that already is affected.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,
who are too poor to buy food,
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --
as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
So it wasn't surprising to me
that as I was traveling around the world
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
I asked a question. "Why?"
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
between this extraordinarily clever brain,
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them,
basically they were either depressed or apathetic,
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,
We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future
and there's nothing we can do about it."
We have compromised their future.
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,
I feel this desperation.
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,
which began right here in Tanzania
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,
environmental and social. It's a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
The most important message of Roots and Shoots:
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things
so that the poor have choice as well.
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.
It depends on how old they are, and which country,
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
And every group chooses, between them,
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,
recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected
and impinge on each other.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities
in other parts of the world.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,
domestic animals as well.
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,
between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa
that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,
South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,
or just using them to feed their families,
and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others
with their vegetables and their chickens.
It's being used in Uganda
to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
Once again, they're useful members of society.
We have this program in prisons as well.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,
with older kids talking to younger ones.
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:
Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,
you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number
from about one million, at the turn of the century,
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I mean, think of the technologies.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
It's one of my hobbyhorses.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
Do we care about their future?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question,
how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,
and we join hands around the world.
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
All of these technologies we can use.
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
This change, this change. To see change
that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
And an example is the TACARE program.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --
if you stop hacking them for firewood,
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:
this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,
the resilience of the human spirit,
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,
and take their part in changing the world.
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.
We could make a very long list,
but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years
of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are so inspirational.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well,
and I've been hearing some of them today.
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message
again, with everyone at TED.
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,
especially the Roots and Shoots program.
And just a last word on that --
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,
I met her today.
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her
and see just one example of how young people,
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,
to make the world a better place,
truly are our hope for tomorrow.
Thank you.

I've been intrigued by this question
of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense --
a sense that would give us seamless access
and easy access to meta-information
or information that may exist somewhere
that may be relevant to help us make the right decision
about whatever it is that we're coming across.
And some of you may argue,
well, don't today's cell phones do that already?
But I would say no.
When you meet someone here at TED --
and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year --
you don't shake somebody's hand
and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment
while I take out my phone and Google you?"
Or when you go to the supermarket
and you're standing there in that huge aisle
of different types of toilet papers,
you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser,
and go to a website to try to decide
which of these different toilet papers
is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
So we don't really have easy access
to all this relevant information
that can just help us make optimal decisions
about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab
has been developing a series of inventions
to give us access to this information
in a sort of easy way,
without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil
our latest effort,
and most successful effort so far,
which is still very much a work in process.
I'm actually wearing the device right now
and we've sort of cobbled it together
with components that are off the shelf --
and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars
at this point in time.
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple webcam,
a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket
which acts as the communication and computation device.
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,
who's really the genius who's been implementing
and designing this whole system.
And we see how this system
lets him walk up to any surface
and start using his hands to interact with the information
that is projected in front of him.
The system tracks the four significant fingers.
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps
that you may recognize.
But if you want a more stylish version
you could also paint your nails in different colors.
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers
and recognizes any gestures that he's making
so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,
zoom in and out, etc.
The system also recognizes iconic gestures
such as the "take a picture" gesture,
and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab,
he can just go up to any wall
and project all the pictures that he's taken,
sort through them and organize them,
and re-size them, etc.,
again using all natural gestures.
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago
and saw the demo by Jeff Han
or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures,
both hands, etc.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface,
you can walk to up to any surface,
including your hand if nothing else is available
and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable,
and can be ...

So one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production
this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones
and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging --
could look a lot more stylish
than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy
of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"
the reason why we're really excited about this device
is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices
that gives you relevant information
about whatever is in front of you.
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket
and he's shopping for some paper towels.
And, as he picks up a product the system can recognize
the product that he's picking up,
using either image recognition or marker technology,
and give him the green light or an orange light.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here
is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it
rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice.

If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
he can get an Amazon rating --
it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,
which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book
and can then see additional information about the book --
reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
If he turns to a particular page
he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours
that gives him a little bit of additional information
about whatever is on that particular page.
Reading the newspaper --
it never has to be outdated.

You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about
You can get the latest sports scores etc.
This is a more controversial one.

As you interact with someone at TED,
maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,
the words that are associated with that person
in their blog and personal web pages.
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
On your way to the airport,
if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,
that the gate has changed, etc.
And, if you need to know what the current time is
it's as simple as drawing a watch --


on your arm.
So that's where we're at so far
in developing this sixth sense
that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information
about the things that we may come across.
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
 
He does deserve a lot of applause
because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years
we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
Thank you.

I'm a visual artist,
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
I've been working with plastic bags,
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork
for the last 20 years.
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces
and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,
some of my work started to fissure
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great.
It's ephemeral just like us."
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,
I actually realized this was a bad thing.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,
because it's always still plastic.
And what we're finding
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
I then, in the last few years,
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
And my initial reaction --
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction
to learning about it --
is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal
to go out with a cargo ship
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,
a crane, a chipping machine
and a cold-molding machine.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,
raise awareness about this issue
and begin to pick up the plastic,
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks
that could potentially be used as building materials
in underdeveloped communities.
I began talking with people
who actually had been out to the gyre
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
and upon doing so,
I realized actually that cleaning it up
would be a very small drop in the bucket
relative to how much is being generated
every day around the world,
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
And the bigger picture is:
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
We need to cut the spigot
of single-use and disposable plastics,
which are entering the marine environment every day
on a global scale.
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.
I wasn't just concerned about plastic
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --
of which I have learned there are now
11 gyres, potentially, of plastic
in five major oceans in the world.
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --
it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,
even at the health food market.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic
into us and into our bodies.
So I came together with a group of other people
who were all looking at this issue,
and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
We have many initiatives that we're working on,
but some of them are very basic.
One is: if 80 to 90 percent
of what we're finding in the ocean --
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,
then why don't we call it what it is.
It's plastic pollution.
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
What is the reality of that?
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
And if you really look into it,
particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,
most of it is only down-cycled,
or incinerated, or shipped to China.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again
or can be used again --
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
So this is a big issue for us.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about
is we've added a fourth R
onto the front
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,
and that is refuse.
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
Alternatives exist;
some of them are very old-school.
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers
to store food in.
And I know that I am doing a service
to myself and my family.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle
or a glass bottle,
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle
and fill that up with water or filtered water,
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers
and we can solve.
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
and teaching people to choose alternatives.
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives
to single-use plastics.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this
into our oceans
and in doing so,
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
Thank you. 
Good morning everybody.
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
The first thing is water.
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water
that's been provided for you here at the conference,
over the past couple of days.
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
But what if it wasn't?
What if it was from a source like this?
Then statistics would actually say
that half of you would now be suffering
with diarrhea.
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
But they just don't seem to get through.
And I think I've worked out why.
It's because, using current thinking,
the scale of the problem
just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
So we just switch off:
us, governments and aid agencies.
Well, today, I'd like to show you
that through thinking differently,
the problem has been solved.
By the way, since I've been speaking,
another 13,000 people around the world
are suffering now with diarrhea.
And four children have just died.
I invented Lifesaver bottle
because I got angry.
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,
when I was watching the devastating news
of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,
playing out on TV.
The days and weeks that followed,
people fleeing to the hills,
being forced to drink contaminated water
or face death.
That really stuck with me.
Then, a few months later,
Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
Okay, I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
Day one: nothing.
Day two: nothing.
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
People were shooting each other on the streets
for TV sets and water.
That's when I decided I had to do something.
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. 
However, after a few failed prototypes,
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Okay, now for the science bit.
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable
of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
So a 200-nanometer bacteria
is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
The smallest virus, on the other hand,
is about 25 nanometers.
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
So nothing is getting through.
Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
Would you like to see that?
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
We're in the fine city of Oxford.
So -- someone's done that up.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone
and got some water from the River Cherwell,
and the River Thames,
that flow through here. And this is the water.
But I got to thinking, you know,
if we were in the middle of a flood zone
in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
And this is from my pond.
  Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.
Okay.  Right.
We're just going to pour that in there.
Audience: Ugh!
Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff
from a sewage plant farm.
So I'm just going to put that in there.

Put that in there. There we go.

And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
So we're just going to put that in there as well.

Okay.  Now.
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
You just scoop the water up.
Today I'm going to use a jug
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?

Okay. There we go.
Replace the top.
Give it a few pumps. Okay?
That's all that's necessary.
Now as soon as I pop the teat,
sterile drinking water is going to come out.
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?
There we go. Mind the electrics.
That is safe, sterile drinking water.

Cheers.

There you go Chris.

What's it taste of?
Chris Anderson: Delicious.
Michael Pritchard: Okay.
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?

Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,
the system will shut off, protecting the user.
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
It's good for another 6,000 liters.
So let's look at the applications.
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
We ship water.
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
Diseases spread. More resources are required.
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
But by thinking differently,
and shipping these,
people can stay put.
They can make their own sterile drinking water,
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster
for this to work.
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure
and pipe work, is too expensive.
When you run the numbers on a calculator,
you run out of noughts.
So here is the "thinking different" bit.
Instead of shipping water,
and using man-made processes to do it,
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
She picks the water up from there,
desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
And where do people live? Near water.
All we've go to do
is make it sterile. How do we do that?
Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
Or we could use one of these.
The same technology, in a jerry can.
This will process 25,000 liters of water;
that's good enough for a family of four,
for three years.
And how much does it cost?
About half a cent a day to run.
Thank you.

So, by thinking differently, and processing water
at the point of use,
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day
to collect their water.
They can get it from a source nearby.
So with just eight billion dollars,
we can hit the millennium goal's target
of halving the number of people
without access to safe drinking water.
To put that into context,
The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds
a year on foreign aid.
But why stop there?
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
So the three-and-a-half billion people
that suffer every year as a result,
and the two million kids that die every year,
will live.
Thank you.

Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today
because of the fact
that we have what most people consider
an unusual friendship.
And it is.
And yet, it feels natural to us now.
I first learned
that my son had been in the World Trade Center
on the morning of September 11th, 2001.
We didn't know
if he had perished yet
until 36 hours later.
At the time,
we knew that it was political.
We were afraid of what our country was going to do
in the name of our son --
my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.
And when I saw it --
and yet, through the shock,
the terrible shock,
and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,
we were not vengeful.
And a couple of weeks later
when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted
on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty
for him, if convicted,
my husband and I spoke out
in opposition to that, publicly.
Through that
and through human rights groups,
we were brought together
with several other victims' families.
When I saw Aicha in the media,
coming over when her son was indicted,
and I thought, "What a brave woman.
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."
I was still in deep grief;
I knew I didn't have the strength.
I knew I would find her someday,
or we would find each other.
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,
I got immediate sympathy.
But when people learned
what her son was accused of,
she didn't get that sympathy.
But her suffering is equal to mine.
So we met in November 2002,
and Aicha will now tell you
how that came about.
 Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
And I asked
the Organization of Human Rights
to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.
So they introduced me
to five families.
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.
She was the only mother in the group.
The others were brothers, sisters.
And I saw in her eyes
that she was a mother, just like me.
I suffered a lot as a mother.
I was married when I was 14.
I lost a child when I was 15,
a second child when I was 16.
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
And I still suffer,
because my son
is like he's buried alive.
I know she really cried for her son.
But she knows where he is.
My son, I don't know where he is.
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.
I don't know what happened to him.
So that's why I decided to tell my story,
so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
For all the women, all the mothers that give life,
you can give back,
you can change.
It's up to us women,
because we are women,
because we love our children.
We must be hand-in-hand
and do something together.
It's not against women,
it's for us, for us women,
for our children.
I talk against violence, against terrorism.
I go to schools
to talk to young, Muslim girls
so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
So if I can save one of the young girls,
and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,
well this is something good.
This is why I'm here in front of you.
PR: I would like to say
that I have learned so much from Aicha,
starting with that day we had our very first meeting
with other family members --
which was a very private meeting with security,
because it was November 2002,
and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --
those of us family members.
But we were all so nervous.
Why does she want to meet us?
And then she was nervous.
Why did we want to meet her?
What did we want from each other?
Before we knew each others' names, or anything,
we had embraced and wept.
Then we sat in a circle
with support, with help,
from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
And Aicha started,
and she said,
I don't know if my son
is guilty or innocent,
but I want to tell you how sorry I am
for what happened to your families.
I know what it is to suffer,
and I feel that if there is a crime,
a person should be tried fairly and punished."
But she reached out to us in that way,
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.
And what happened then is we all told our stories,
and we all connected as human beings.
By the end of the afternoon --
it was about three hours after lunch --
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.
Now what I learned from her,
is a woman, not only who could be so generous
under these present circumstances
and what it was then,
and what was being done to her son,
but the life she's had.
I never had met
someone with such a hard life,
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
And I feel
that we have
a special connection,
which I value very much.
And I think it's all about
being afraid of the other,
but making that step
and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.
Who else can I meet that I don't know,
or that I'm so different from?"
So, Aicha,
do you have a couple of words
for conclusion?
Because our time is up.

 AW: I wanted to say
that we have to try to know other people, the other.
You have to be generous,
and your hearts must be generous,
your mind must be generous.
You must be tolerant.
You have to fight against violence.
And I hope that someday we'll all live together
in peace and respecting each other.
This is what I wanted to say.

There's a poem written
by a very famous English poet
at the end of the 19th century.
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain
in the 1930s.
And the poem goes:
On the idle hill of summer,
lazy with the flow of streams,
hark I hear a distant drummer,
drumming like a sound in dreams,
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,
dear to friend and food to powder,
soldiers marching,
soon to die."
Those who are interested in poetry,
the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
But what Housman understood,
and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,
was that the long, hot, silvan summers
of stability of the 19th century
were coming to a close,
and that we were about to move
into one of those terrifying periods of history
when power changes.
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,
accompanied by turbulence,
and all too often by blood.
And my message for you
is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,
to live at just one of those moments in history
when the gimbals upon which
the established order of power is beginning to change
and the new look of the world,
the new powers that exist in the world,
are beginning to take form.
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --
nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,
and all too often very bloody times.
By the way, it happens about once every century.
You might argue that the last time it happened --
and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --
was that when power passed from the old nations,
the old powers of Europe,
across the Atlantic to the new emerging power
of the United States of America --
the beginning of the American century.
And of course, into the vacuum
where the too-old European powers used to be
were played the two bloody catastrophes
of the last century --
the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,
and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
we live at one of those times.
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
And the first of these, the first two of these,
is about a shift in power.
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,
which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
And what is happening today
is, in one sense, frightening
because it's never happened before.
We have seen lateral shifts of power --
the power of Greece passed to Rome
and the power shifts that occurred
during the European civilizations --
but we are seeing something slightly different.
For power is not just moving laterally
from nation to nation.
It's also moving vertically.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased,
held to accountability, held to the rule of law,
within the institution of the nation state
has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
The globalization of power --
we talk about the globalization of markets,
but actually it's the globalization of real power.
And where, at the nation state level
that power is held to accountability
subject to the rule of law,
on the international stage it is not.
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:
the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,
the power of the money changers --
this vast money-go-round
that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary
for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --
the money changers, if you like,
the financial speculators
that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,
the power of the multinational corporations
now developing budgets
often bigger than medium-sized countries.
These live in a global space
which is largely unregulated,
not subject to the rule of law,
and in which people may act free of constraint.
Now that suits the powerful
up to a moment.
It's always suitable for those who have the most power
to operate in spaces without constraint,
but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,
unregulated space --
space not subject to the rule of law --
becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --
international trade, the Internet, etc. --
but also by the things you don't want --
international criminality, international terrorism.
The revelation of 9/11
is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,
nevertheless,
those who inhabit that space can attack you
even in your most iconic of cities
one bright September morning.
It's said that something like 60 percent
of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11
actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers
which 9/11 destroyed.
You see, our enemies also use this space --
the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --
to be able to get around their poison,
which is about destroying our systems and our ways.
Sooner or later,
sooner or later,
the rule of history
is that where power goes
governance must follow.
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,
that one of the phenomenon of our time
is the globalization of power,
then it follows that one of the challenges of our time
is to bring governance to the global space.
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now
will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:
to bring governance to the global space.
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.
I'm not talking about setting up
some global democratic institution.
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
is that this is unlikely to be done
by spawning more U.N. institutions.
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
The world needs an international forum.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
But when it comes to governance of the global space,
my guess is this won't happen
through the creation of more U.N. institutions.
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together
and making treaty-based systems,
treaty-based agreements,
to govern that global space.
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,
entirely treaty-based,
and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,
to account if necessary.
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create
a treaty-based organization.
The G20:
we know now that we have to put together an institution
which is capable of bringing governance
to that financial space for financial speculation.
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
Now there's a problem there,
and we'll come back to it in a minute,
which is that if you bring the most powerful together
to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,
to fill that governance space,
then what happens to the weak who are left out?
And that's a big problem,
and we'll return to it in just a second.
So there's my first message,
that if you are to pass through these turbulent times
more or less turbulently,
then our success in doing that
will in large measure depend on our capacity
to bring sensible governance
to the global space.
And watch that beginning to happen.
My second point is,
and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this
about such a thing,
but power is not just shifting vertically,
it's also shifting horizontally.
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,
has been civilizations gathered around seas --
with the first ones around the Mediterranean,
the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
Well it seems to me
that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,
away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]
to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
Now that begins with economic power,
but that's the way it always begins.
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,
the augmentation of military budgets
occurring in the other growing powers in the world.
I think actually
this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;
something different is happening.
My guess is, for what it's worth,
is that the United States will remain
the most powerful nation on earth
for the next 10 years, 15,
but the context in which she holds her power
has now radically altered; it has radically changed.
We are coming out of 50 years,
most unusual years, of history
in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,
in which every compass needle
for or against
has to be referenced by its position to Washington --
a world bestrode by a single colossus.
But that's not a usual case in history.
In fact, what's now emerging
is the much more normal case of history.
You're beginning to see the emergence
of a multi-polar world.
Up until now,
the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
They will remain the most powerful nation,
but they will be the most powerful nation
in an increasingly multi-polar world.
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --
in China, of course,
though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
It's going to be quite grumpy
as China begins to democratize her society
after liberalizing her economy.
But that's a subject of a different discussion.
You see India, you see Brazil.
You see increasingly
that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,
much more like Europe in the 19th century.
Europe in the 19th century:
a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,
used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.
Britain always played to the balance.
If Paris got together with Berlin,
Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
Now notice,
in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,
you have fixed alliances --
NATO, the Warsaw Pact.
A fixed polarity of power
means fixed alliances.
But a multiple polarity of power
means shifting and changing alliances.
And that's the world we're coming into,
in which we will increasingly see
that our alliances are not fixed.
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,
Britain has a common interest,
but no common allies."
And we will see increasingly
that even we in the West
will reach out, have to reach out,
beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers
to make alliances with others
if we want to get things done in the world.
Note, that when we went into Libya,
it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;
we had to bring others in.
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times
when the West has tried to do it themselves,
and we haven't succeeded.
My guess
is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --
I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --
of the hegemony of Western power,
Western institutions and Western values.
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,
it could propose and dispose
in every corner of the world.
But that's no longer true.
Take the last financial crisis
after the Second World War.
The West got together --
the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --
the problem solved.
Now we have to call in others.
Now we have to create the G20.
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle
of our Western friends.
Let me make a prediction for you,
which is probably even more startling.
I suspect we are now reaching the end
of 400 years
when Western power was enough.
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course,
they'll never get themselves involved
in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."
Oh yes? Why not?
How many Chinese troops
are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,
serving under the U.N. command in the world today?
3,700.00
How many Americans? 11.
What is the largest naval contingent
tackling the issue of Somali pirates?
The Chinese naval contingent.
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
They want to keep the sea lanes open.
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business
with people with whom we do not share values,
but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
It's a whole new different way
of looking at the world that is now emerging.
And here's the third factor,
which is totally different.
Today in our modern world,
because of the Internet,
because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,
everything is connected to everything.
We are now interdependent.
We are now interlocked,
as nations, as individuals,
in a way which has never been the case before,
never been the case before.
The interrelationship of nations,
well it's always existed.
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
But now we are intimately locked together.
You get swine flu in Mexico,
it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport
24 hours later.
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
There are fires in the steppes of Russia,
food riots in Africa.
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
And what that means
is the idea of a nation state acting alone,
not connected with others,
not working with others,
is no longer a viable proposition.
Because the actions of a nation state
are neither confined to itself,
nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself
to control its own territory,
because the effects outside the nation state
are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
I was a young soldier
in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
At that time, the defense of my country
was about one thing and one thing only:
how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,
how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.
Now the enemy is inside the walls.
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,
I have to speak to the Minister of Health
because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,
I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
because food security is a threat to my security,
I have to speak to the Minister of Industry
because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure
is now a point of attack for our enemies --
as we see from cyber warfare --
I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs
because who has entered my country,
who lives in that terraced house in that inner city
has a direct effect on what happens in my country --
as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
It's no longer the case that the security of a country
is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.
And this tells you something very important.
It tells you that, in fact,
our governments, vertically constructed,
constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --
vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,
command structures --
have got the wrong structures completely.
You in business know
that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,
is the network.
It's your capacity to network that matters,
both within your governments and externally.
So here is Ashdown's third law.
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law
because I haven't invented those yet;
it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,
where everything is connected to everything,
the most important thing about what you can do
is what you can do with others.
The most important bit about your structure --
whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,
whether you're a business --
is your docking points, your interconnectors,
your capacity to network with others.
You understand that in industry;
governments don't.
But now one final thing.
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --
that we are now locked together
in a way that has never been quite the same before,
then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
Suddenly and for the very first time,
collective defense, the thing that has dominated us
as the concept of securing our nations,
is no longer enough.
It used to be the case
that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;
if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;
my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
It is no longer the case.
The advent of the interconnectedness
and of the weapons of mass destruction
means that, increasingly,
I share a destiny with my enemy.
When I was a diplomat
negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union
in Geneva in the 1970s,
we succeeded because we understood
we shared a destiny with them.
Collective security is not enough.
Peace has come to Northern Ireland
because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
They shared a destiny with their enemies.
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East
is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,
do not understand
that they share a collective destiny.
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen,
what has been the proposition
of visionaries and poets down the ages
becomes something we have to take seriously
as a matter of public policy.
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.
The great poem of John Donne's.
Send not for whom the bell tolls.
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
And it goes:
Every man's death affected me,
for I am involved in mankind,
send not to ask
for whom the bell tolls,
it tolls for thee."
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.
For us, I think,
part of the equation for our survival.
Thank you very much.

Something called the Danish Twin Study
established that only about 10 percent
of how long the average person lives,
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
optimal lifestyle of longevity
we can come up with a de facto formula
for longevity.
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
You have the USDA food pyramid.
There is what Oprah tells us.
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion
around what really helps us live longer better.
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?
Should you eat organic meats
or should you be eating tofu?
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
How about these hormones or resveratrol?
And does purpose play into it?
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?
Well, our approach to finding longevity
was to team up with National Geographic,
and the National Institute on Aging,
to find the four demographically confirmed areas
that are geographically defined.
And then bring a team of experts in there
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths
when it comes to longevity.
And the first myth is if you try really hard
you can live to be 100.
False.
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
in America live to be 100.
Your chances are very low.
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,
it's hard to reach 100.
The problem is
that we're not programmed for longevity.
We are programmed for something called
procreative success.
I love that word.
It reminds me of my college days.
Biologists term procreative success to mean
the age where you have children
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
After that the effect of evolution
completely dissipates.
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
the genetic lottery.
The second myth is,
there are treatments that can help slow,
reverse, or even stop aging.
False.
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,
those brain cells die, they never come back.
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,
the cartilage never comes back.
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,
and we can get Alzheimer's.
There is just too many things to go wrong.
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.

Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
And every time they turn themselves over
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
And it builds up exponentially.
It's a little bit like the days when we all had
Beatles albums or Eagles albums
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,
and pretty soon, with successive generations
that tape sounds like garbage.
Well, the same things happen to our cells.
That's why a 65-year-old person
is aging at a rate of about
125 times faster
than a 12-year-old person.
So, if there is nothing you can do
to slow your aging or stop your aging,
what am I doing here?
Well, the fact of the matter is
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,
my body, your body,
is about 90 years,
a little bit more for women.
But life expectancy in this country
is only 78.
So somewhere along the line,
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
These are years that we could get.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
We think the best way to get these missing years
is to look at the cultures around the world
that are actually experiencing them,
areas where people are living to age 100
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,
areas where the life expectancy
is an extra dozen years,
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
of what it is in this country.
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
And here we have this area where men live the longest,
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,
they do so with extraordinary vigor.
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.

Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
Because the land is so infertile,
they largely are shepherds,
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
Their diet is mostly plant-based,
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,
and a type of wine that has three times the level
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
It's called Cannonau.
But the real secret I think lies more
in the way that they organize their society.
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society
is how they treat older people.
You ever notice here in America, social equity
seems to peak at about age 24?
Just look at the advertisements.
Here in Sardinia, the older you get
the more equity you have,
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.
You go into the bars in Sardinia,
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents
to keep them close to the family --
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
That's called the grandmother effect.
We found our second Blue Zone
on the other side of the planet,
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,
on the archipelago of Okinawa.
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.
And in the northern part of the main island,
this is ground zero for world longevity.
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free
life expectancy in the world.
They have what we want.
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
very quickly,
and often, I can tell you, after sex.
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,
big killers here in America.
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.
What do they do?
Once again, a plant-based diet,
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.
And they eat about eight times as much tofu
as Americans do.
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
They have all kinds of little strategies
to keep from overeating,
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
A few of the strategies we observed:
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
Instead of serving family style,
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,
they serve at the counter, put the food away,
and then bring it to the table.
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
It was invented by Confucius.
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling
to travel from your belly to your brain.
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs
that we can associate with longevity.
We know that isolation kills.
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
We're down to one and half right now.
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,
you were born into a system where you
automatically have a half a dozen friends
with whom you travel through life.
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,
and if things go bad,
child gets sick, parent dies,
you always have somebody who has your back.
This particular Moai, these five ladies
have been together for 97 years.
Their average age is 102.
Typically in America
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.
There is our work life,
where we're productive.
And then one day, boom, we retire.
And typically that has meant
retiring to the easy chair,
or going down to Arizona to play golf.
In the Okinawan language there is not even
a word for retirement.
Instead there is one word
that imbues your entire life,
and that word is "ikigai."
And, roughly translated, it means
the reason for which you wake up in the morning.
For this 102-year-old karate master,
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.
For this hundred-year-old fisherman
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,
the people who put the questionnaire.
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
And I asked her what it felt like
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
And she put her head back and she said,
It feels like leaping into heaven.
I thought that was a wonderful thought.
My editor at Geographic
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
But that's because all the young people left.

So, we turned to the data again.
And we found America's longest-lived population
among the Seventh-Day Adventists
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.
Adventists are conservative Methodists.
They celebrate their Sabbath
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.
And they follow five little habits
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,
comparatively speaking.
In America here, life expectancy
for the average woman is 80.
But for an Adventist woman,
their life expectancy is 89.
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,
who are expected to live about 11 years
longer than their American counterparts.
Now, this is a study that followed
about 70,000 people for 30 years.
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates
the premise of this Blue Zone project.
This is a heterogeneous community.
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
The only thing that they have in common are a set of
very small lifestyle habits
that they follow ritualistically
for most of their lives.
They take their diet directly from the Bible.
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],
where God talks about legumes and seeds,
and on one more stanza about green plants,
ostensibly missing is meat.
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.
For 24 hours every week,
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,
where the kids need to be driven,
they stop everything and they focus on their God,
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,
are nature walks.
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
So, if you go to an Adventist's party
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
He's a multimillionaire,
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars
to build a privacy fence,
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,
and hauling poles around.
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day
he ended up in the operating room.
But not as the guy on the table;
the guy doing open-heart surgery.
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,
throw up rooster tails.
And then Marge Deton.
Marge is 104.
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
She starts her day with lifting weights.
She rides her bicycle.
And then she gets in her root-beer colored
1994 Cadillac Seville,
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet
who rode his bicycle across
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.
A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet! she'd say to me.
So, what are the common denominators
in these three cultures?
What are the things that they all do?
And we managed to boil it down to nine.
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this
and these common denominators hold true.
And the first one,
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,
none of them exercise,
at least the way we think of exercise.
Instead, they set up their lives
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
These 100-year-old Okinawan women
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,
30 or 40 times a day.
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.
Every trip to the store, or to church
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.
They don't have any conveniences.
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.
That's physical activity.
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
When they do do intentional physical activity,
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,
and they all tend to have a garden.
They know how to set up their life in the right way
so they have the right outlook.
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's
disease to cardiovascular disease.
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day
you turn that inflammatory state
into a more anti-inflammatory state.
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,
ikigai, like the Okinawans.
You know the two most dangerous years in your life
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,
and the year you retire.
These people know their sense of purpose,
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years
of extra life expectancy.
There's no longevity diet.
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,
not a hard sell to the American population.

They tend to eat a plant-based diet.
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.
They put their families first,
take care of their children and their aging parents.
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,
which is worth between four and 14
extra years of life expectancy
if you do it four times a month.
And the biggest thing here
is they also belong to the right tribe.
They were either born into
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
We know from the Framingham studies,
that if your three best friends are obese
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,
biking or gardening,
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.
Exercise programs usually start in January;
they're usually done by October.
When it comes to longevity
there is no short term fix
in a pill or anything else.
But when you think about it,
your friends are long-term adventures,
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do
to add more years to your life,
and life to your years. Thank you very much.

Those of you who know me know how passionate I am
about opening the space frontier.
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
And I want to tell you that story.
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
We have something called the Genome 100 --
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
And I met Professor Hawking,
and he said his dream was to travel into space.
And I said, "I can't take you there,
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth
is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
You do it again and again.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --
how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
We set out to do this.
It took us 11 years to become operational.
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.

And he wanted to go.
We worked hard to get all the permissions.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
We had a press conference,
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,
give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk
of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
We had about 20 people who made donations --
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --
who flew with us.
A few TEDsters here.
We set up a whole ER.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
We took off from the shuttle landing facility,
where the shuttle takes off and lands.
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I
carefully suspended him into zero-g.
Once he was there, [we] let him go
to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
And after that first parabola, you know,
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
So we did a second parabola.


And a third.

We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge
that Isaac Newton did.
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.

And a seventh and an eighth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.

He was so happy.
We are living on a precious jewel,
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
Please join us in this epic adventure.
Thank you so much.

I'm a medical illustrator,
and I come from a slightly different point of view.
I've been watching, since I grew up,
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
and truth and beauty in the sciences.
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --
they both have very wonderful things going for them --
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
that a scientist would want to date.

These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,
by meaning they are things you can worship.
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
They are unique. They are useful --
sometimes, often a long time after the fact.
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.
Truth and beauty are things
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
They are things that describe beauty in a way
that is often only accessible if you understand the language
and the syntax of the person
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
If you look at the math, E=mc squared,
if you look at the cosmological constant,
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
from the numbers that describe the universe --
these are things that are really difficult to understand.
And what I've tried to do
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --
since I was taught animation by my father,
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --
I wanted to figure out a way to help people
understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
Students today are often immersed in an environment
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
are not always evident.
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
We don't want to do that to our students.
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,
in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
would be interested and willing to really change
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --
that would explore the truth and beauty inherent
in molecular and cellular biology
so that students could understand a larger picture
that they could hang all of these facts on.
They could have a mental image of the cell
as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city
that's occupied by micro-machines.
And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
These micro-machines,
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices
that are made out of strings of amino acids.
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
They power our minds.
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out
how we could make this story into an animation
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
which is a website that Harvard has
for its molecular and cellular biology students
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,
in addition to all the didactic stuff --
put everything together visually, so that these students
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
so that their passions would be sparked
and so that they would be able to go on
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages
that are streaming down a capillary,
and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,
and they're picking up information from cells
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information
that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,
where they can't see and sense.
But they get the information that causes them to stop,
causes them to internalize that they need to make
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
So these molecular motors -- we had to work
with the Harvard scientists and databank models
of the atomically accurate molecules
and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
And figure out how to do this in a way
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,
but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell
would prevent the vista from happening.
And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute
Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film
that we produced. It's an ongoing project
that's going to go another four or five years.
And I want you to look at this
and see the paths that the cell manufactures --
these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --
that take these huge loads
that would challenge an ant in relative size.
Run the movie, please.
But these machines that power the inside of the cells
are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
because all of these machines interact with each other.
They pass information to each other.
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs
on the fly, from information
that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
would be possible without these little micro-machines.
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,
have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.


This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.
This little guy is called the kinesin,
and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
to wherever it's needed in the cell --
whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,
whether it's to build something or repair something.
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things
running around, right now,
inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
So no matter how lazy you feel,
you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.

So what I want you to do when you go home
is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
And think about some of the things
that we're learning about cellular mechanics.
Once we figure out all that's going on --
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --
once we figure out what's going on,
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control
over what we do with our health,
with what we do with future generations,
and how long we're going to live.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this
to discover more truth, and more beauty.

But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,
are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
And their working together helps our bodies --
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.

I'm a writer and a journalist,
and I'm also an insanely curious person,
so in 22 years as a journalist,
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do
was to become invisible.
I became one of the working homeless.
I quit my job as a newspaper editor
after my father died in February of that same year,
and decided to travel.
His death hit me pretty hard.
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
I've camped my whole life. And I decided
that living in a van for a year to do this
would be like one long camping trip.
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler
and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,
and drove off into the sunset,
having fully failed to realize three critical things.
One: that society equates
living in a permanent structure, even a shack,
with having value as a person.
Two: I failed to realize how quickly
the negative perceptions of other people
can impact our reality, if we let it.
Three: I failed to realize
that homelessness is an attitude,
not a lifestyle.
At first, living in the van was great.
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job
to pay the bills.
What had been a really mild spring
turned into a miserably hot summer.
And it became impossible to park anywhere --

#NAME?
that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
The doggy went into doggy day care.
And I sweated.
Whenever I could, I used
employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
Food rotted in the heat.
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,
and it was pretty miserable.
I couldn't afford to find an apartment,
or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me
to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
And I refused to give them up,
so I stayed in the van.
And when the heat made me too sick
to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom
outside my van at night,
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped
below freezing. And they stayed there.
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
I parked a different place every night
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
I didn't always succeed.
But I felt out of control of my life.
And I don't know when or how it happened,
but the speed at which I went
from being a talented writer and journalist
to being a homeless woman, living in a van,
took my breath away.
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
My talent, my integrity, my values,
everything about me remained the same.
But I had changed somehow.
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
I just wasn't drunk or high.
And when several of the homeless men realized that,
including a former university professor,
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,
but I did.
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,
You have a job. You have hope.
The real homeless don't have hope."
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression
left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,
If I killed myself, no one would notice.
A friend told me, shortly after that,
that she had heard that Tim Russert,
a nationally renowned journalist,
had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I'd written about my father,
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"
was talking about my writing,
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
I started laughing.
You should too.

I started laughing
because it got to the point where,
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.
And I cried.
Because I was a writer.
I was a writer.
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
And I started writing again.
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
I was no longer homeless.
And I was no longer invisible.
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs,
and live in their cars.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize
living in your vehicle or on the streets.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
But if you ever meet one,
engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,
people are not where they live,
where they sleep,
or what their life situation is at any given time.
Three years ago I was living in a van
in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
and today I'm speaking at TED.
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

Welcome to Thailand.
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,
the country was very, very poor
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
We decided to do something about it,
but we didn't begin with a welfare program
or a poverty reduction program.
But we began with a family-planning program,
following a very successful
maternal child health activity,
sets of activities.
So basically, no one would accept family planning
if their children didn't survive.
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,
and then follow up with family planning.
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
Now let me take you back
as to why we needed to do it.
In my country, that was the case in 1974.
Seven children per family --
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
There was just no future.
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.
So we said, "Let's do it."
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"
and we had very, very few doctors.
We didn't take no as an answer;
we took no as a question.
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,
and did a fantastic job
at explaining how to use the pill.
That was wonderful,
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.
What do we do for the other 80 percent --
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
No, we decided to do a bit more.
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
Actually, below that yellow sign --
I wish they hadn't wiped that,
because there was "Coca-Cola" there.
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
And no difference,
the people they chose were the people we chose.
They were well-known in the community,
they knew that customers were always right,
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
So they could supply pills and condoms
throughout the country, in every village of the country.
So there we are. We went to the people
who were seen as the cause of the problem
to be the solution.
Wherever there were people --
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --
here's the floating market
selling bananas and crabs
and also contraceptives --
wherever you find people,
you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.
And then we decided, why not get to religion
because in the Philippines,
the Catholic Church was pretty strong,
and Thai people were Buddhist.
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --
holding a bowl of holy water
for the monk to sprinkle holy water
on pills and condoms
for the sanctity of the family.
And this picture was sent throughout the country.
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
It's been blessed."
That was their perception.
And then we went to teachers.
You need everybody to be involved
in trying to provide whatever it is
that make humanity a better place.
So we went to the teachers.
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,
I for IUD, V for vasectomy.
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
Very good, mother. Move ahead.
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."

Again, education, class entertainment.
And the kids were doing it in school too.
We had relay races with condoms,
we had children's condom-blowing championship.
And before long,
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --
so the condom is the girl's best friend.
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,
and the women who organized it said,
We only want to lend
to women who practice family planning.
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
And that was run by them.
And after 35/36 years,
it's still going on.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --
it was run by the villagers themselves.
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
it's always women, women, women, women.
And then we thought we'd help America,
because America's been helping everyone,
whether they want help or not.

And this is on the Fourth of July.
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,
right up to the Ambassador's residence
during his [unclear].
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --
very appropriate room.

And since it was near lunch time,
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
Of course, it must be American cola.
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.

And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm
who worked for the USAID.
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."

And what happened?
In all this thing,
from seven children to 1.5 children,
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --
it was exactly the same thing.
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,
but we're good friends.
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
But it's everybody's job
who can change attitude and behavior.
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand,
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things
to fight AIDS.
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
So our work wasn't affected.
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
So I went to the military
and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
They have more than the government,
and they've got more guns than the government.
So I asked them, could they help us
in our fight against HIV.
And after I gave them statistics,
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
So I said, "Okay."
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee
and increased the budget fifty-fold.
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,
religious institutions, schools --
everyone was involved.
And here, every media person
had to be trained for HIV.
And we gave every station half a minute extra
for advertising to earn more money.
So they were happy with that.
And then AIDS education in all schools,
starting from university.
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
and they were terrific.
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV
were known as Mother Theresa.
And then we went down one more step.
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --
going to every household in the village,
every household in the whole of Thailand,
giving AIDS information and a condom
to every household,
given by these young kids.
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,
and this was a lifesaver.
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."
So you have the companies also realizing
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
So they all trained.
And then we have this Captain Condom,
with his Harvard MBA,
going to schools and night spots.
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.

And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --
everywhere, everywhere.
In taxis, you get condoms.
And also, in traffic,
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.

So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.
Imagine if they had condoms,
giving out to all sorts of people.
And then, new change,
we had hair bands, clothing
and the condom for your mobile phone
during the rainy season.

And these were the condoms that we introduced.
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."
We found --
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
And then it says here, with the American flag,
Don't leave home without it.
But I have some to give out afterward.
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,
so be very careful.

And so you can see
that condoms can do so many things.
Look at this --
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
Stop global warming; use condoms.
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --
the weapon of mass protection.
And let the next Olympics save some lives.
Why just run around?

And then finally,
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."

So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor
to make life better for the people.
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,
because alcohol impairs judgment.
And then what happened?
After all this time, everybody joined in.
According to the U.N.,
new cases of HIV
declined by 90 percent,
and according to the World Bank,
7.7 million lives were saved.
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
There was political commitment, some financial commitment,
and everybody joined in the fight.
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
We all need to help.
And then we decided to help people out of poverty,
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --
this time, not with government alone,
but in cooperation with the business community.
Because poor people are business people
who lack business skills and access to credit.
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,
little business people.
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
So, that was done.
The money goes from the company into the village
via tree-planting.
It's not a free gift.
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,
which we call the Village Development Bank.
Everybody joins in,
and they feel they own the bank,
because they have brought the money in.
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.
And we believe if you want to help the poor,
those who are living in poverty,
access to credit must be a human right.
Access to credit must be a human right.
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"
teaching people how to do business
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
These are some of the businesses:
mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,
trees, fruits,
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
this is a village sponsored by Nike.
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
Make these better, because we can afford them."
And then we have silk, Thai silk.
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,
to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
So anyone sitting in and watching TV,
get in touch with me.
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --
Coffee and Condoms.
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
That's the difference.
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks
that you can also get condoms?
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
And then now, finally in education,
we want to change the school as being underutilized
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
And it's a center, a focal point
for economic and social development.
Re-do the school,
make it serve the community needs.
And here is a bamboo building --
all of them are bamboo.
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud
to see a bamboo geodesic dome.
And we use vegetables around the school ground,
so they raise their own vegetables.
And then, finally, I firmly believe,
if we want the MDGs to work --
the Millennium Development Goals --
we need to add family planning to it.
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --
everyone needs family planning service --
it's underutilized.
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
And we also ask the next Olympics
to be involved in saving lives.
And then, finally, that is our network.
And these are our Thai tulips.

Thank you very much indeed.

Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here
among the smartest of the smart.
I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.
There's a Jewish saying that I love.
What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.
I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth
about our common humanity.
All stories interest me, and some haunt me
until I end up writing them.
Certain themes keep coming up:
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,
freedom.
I'm aware of the mystery around us,
so I write about coincidences, premonitions,
emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic.
In the last 20 years I have published a few books,
but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,
when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.
That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,
of the opening ceremony,
called me and said that I had been selected
to be one of the flag-bearers.
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity
because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.
Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium
without a walker.

I was told that this was no laughing matter.
This would be the first time
that only women would carry the Olympic flag.
Five women, representing five continents,
and three Olympic gold medal winners.
My first question was, naturally,
what was I going to wear?

A uniform, she said,
and asked for my measurements.
My measurements.
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,
looking like the Michelin Man.

By the middle of February,
I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds
cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.
They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.
A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,
can determine the result of a race or a game.
However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.
It is all about passion.
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters
announcing the slogan of the Olympics.
Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.
That is what I need for my characters in my books:
a passionate heart.
I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,
who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.
People like all of you in this room.
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.

They only make good former spouses.


In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:
three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.
Also, two women with passionate hearts:
Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya
who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,
she has changed the soil, the weather,
in some places in Africa, and of course
the economic conditions in many villages.
And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately
against child prostitution.
When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that
having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,
15 clients per day,
and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.
In the green room I received my uniform.
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit
that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.
I looked like a refrigerator.

But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.
She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.
Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?
I don't know.
When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?"
She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,
and I don't make old people's noises."

So, there you have some free advice
from one of the most beautiful women on earth.
No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

Well, she didn't say that exactly.

At some point around midnight,
we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,
and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --
by the way, the same music that starts here,
the Aida March.
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,
not counting the poofy hair.

She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,
holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind

-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,
so that my head was actually under the damn flag.

All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.
That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos
I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.

A place where most men would love to be.


The best four minutes of my entire life
were those in the Olympic stadium.
My husband is offended when I say this --
although I have explained to him that what we do in private
usually takes less than four minutes --

-- so he shouldn't take it personally.
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,
because I don't want to forget them
when old age destroys my brain cells.
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --
passion.
So here's a tale of passion.
The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world
are women and girls.
We can call this place in Congo a death camp,
because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.
The protagonists of this story
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.
She's pregnant and a widow.
Soldiers have forced her to watch
as her husband was tortured and killed.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,
and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.
Two tiny little boys.
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,
and ties it with her own hair.
She names the twins after the camp's commanders
to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea
because her milk cannot sustain them.
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,
she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,
even when they hold a gun to her head.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,
and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,
who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,
where they're now living and thriving.
Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women
like Rose Mapendo.
I don't make them up. There's no need for that.
I look around and I see them everywhere.
I have worked with women and for women all my life.
I know them well.
I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,
in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --
although the term had not reached Chile yet,
so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.

I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay
for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.
But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,
I was able to deliver two.

Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,
she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.
We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?
Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,
but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world
who are still forced into premature marriage,
prostitution, forced labor --
they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.
They have no control over their bodies or their lives.
They have no education and no freedom.
They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.
For most Western young women of today,
being called a feminist is an insult.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you
that it never stopped me from flirting,
and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.

Feminism is not dead, by no means.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term,
change it, for Goddess' sake.
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;
the name doesn't matter,
as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.
The year is 2005.
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer
during her three-week vacation.
She's prepared to clean teeth,
but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,
no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.
Outside, there is a line of women
who have waited several hours to be treated.
The first patient is in excruciating pain
because she has several rotten molars.
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.
She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.
She risks a lot and she's terrified.
She doesn't even have the proper instruments,
but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.
At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,
her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.
Jenny is horrified at what she has done,
but then the translator explains
that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.
The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home
in time to prepare dinner for him.
Millions of women live like this today.
They are the poorest of the poor.
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,
they own less than one percent of the world's assets.
They are paid less than men for the same work
if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable
because they have no economic independence,
and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,
violence and abuse.
It is a fact that giving women education, work,
the ability to control their own income,
inherit and own property, benefits the society.
If a woman is empowered,
her children and her family will be better off.
If families prosper, the village prospers,
and eventually so does the whole country.
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren
because they have cut and sold the trees.
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,
drop by drop.
In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
The poorest and most backward societies
are always those that put women down.
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments
and also by philanthropy.
For every dollar given to a women's program,
20 dollars are given to men's programs.
Women are 51 percent of humankind.
Empowering them will change everything --
more than technology and design and entertainment.
I can promise you that women working together --
linked, informed and educated --
can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,
mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.
Men run the world, and look at the mess we have.
What kind of world do we want?
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?
We want a world where life is preserved
and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,
not only for the privileged.
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings
at the UC Berkeley library.
No museum or gallery in the United States,
except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,
has dared to show the paintings because the theme
is the Abu Ghraib prison.
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,
in the voluminous Botero style.
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind
or my heart.
What I fear most is power with impunity.
I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.
In our species, the alpha males define reality,
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality
and follow the rules.
The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,
which does not work in economics, works perfectly.
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.
Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --
a woman or a child.
I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many
through gender, income, race, and class.
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes
in our civilization.
But for real change, we need feminine energy
in the management of the world.
We need a critical number of women in positions of power,
and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.
I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.
Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.

Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs
and legendary breasts.
But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.
I want to make this world good.
Not better, but to make it good.
Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves
and get to work, passionately,
in creating an almost perfect world.
Thank you.
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop
or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,
there is going to be food there waiting for us,
having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,
enough food has to be produced,
transported, bought and sold,
cooked, eaten, disposed of,
and that something similar has to happen every day
for every city on earth,
it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if
they're the most natural things in the world,
forgetting that because we're animals
and that we need to eat,
we're actually as dependent on the natural world
as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities,
more of that natural world is being
transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --
it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --
in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes,
but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes
are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities,
more of us are eating meat,
so that a third of the annual grain crop globally
now gets fed to animals
rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain --
actually ten times as much grain --
to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,
that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number
of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much
meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,
by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,
it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year
to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount
of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie
of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,
we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,
we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now
is controlled by just five multinational corporations,
it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future,
it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,
about 10,000 years ago, I would say,
is the beginning of this process
in the ancient Near East,
known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,
that two extraordinary inventions,
agriculture and urbanism, happened
roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident,
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain
by our ancient ancestors for the first time
that produced a food source that was large enough
and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like,
we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land
and dominated by large temple complexes
like this one at Ur,
that were, in fact, effectively,
spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,
gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,
and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like,
the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities
was dominated by the grain and the harvest
that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens
by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea,
which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,
because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,
which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war
on places like Carthage and Egypt
just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire
was really sort of one long, drawn out
militarized shopping spree, really.

In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:
Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,
at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland
through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also
happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,
we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,
along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them
to Cheapside, which was the main market,
were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets,
Bread Street, you can tell
what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,
operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around
with mobile phones that looked like bricks
and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities:
Once its roots into the city are established,
they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story
because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat
was coming from the northwest,
from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,
which is why Smithfield,
London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
and so the birds were coming in
with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end
of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,
which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city
built before the industrial age,
you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,
both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life,
is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces
were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830
you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this
and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,
the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window
about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city,
part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers
were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,
somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible
for the first time to grow cities,
really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography;
they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London,
in the 90 years after the trains came,
it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed
by animals coming in on foot, and so on,
to a large splurge,
that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,
either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city
from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,
devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,
drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,
came back with a week's worth of shopping,
and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship,
both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center,
the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water,
or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems
is that they've made the very thing they promised
to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,
they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,
which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,
that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,
if that sounds remotely familiar,
a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,
and grew vegetables in their back gardens,
and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that
food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,
even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,
that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,
joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be
the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with
this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,
that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool
for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,
that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative,
which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,
sitos for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food,
and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --
a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- 
it's food at the center of life,
at the center of family life, being celebrated,
being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food,
who think ahead, who plan,
who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables
and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,
food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,
and is not just a zero-sum commodity
off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project
I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told
all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a
plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects
that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia
already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up,
to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities
as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this,
as part of the productive, organic framework
of which they are inevitably a part,
symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either,
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture,
which is why I think this image just
sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization
of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country,
the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now,
what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint
if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask,
and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food
as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.

For years I've been feeling frustrated,
because as a religious historian,
I've become acutely aware
of the centrality of compassion
in all the major world faiths.
Every single one of them
has evolved their own version
of what's been called the Golden Rule.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --
Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.
And equally important
is the negative version --
Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.
Look into your own heart,
discover what it is that gives you pain
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,
to inflict that pain on anybody else.
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,
not just because it sounds good,
but because it works.
People have found that when they have
implemented the Golden Rule
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day
and then returning to a life of greed
and egotism,
but to do it all day and every day,
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,
put another there, and you transcend yourself.
And it brings you into the presence
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Something that goes beyond
what we know in our ego-bound existence.
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,
that this was so central to the religious life.
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,
very often when religious people come together,
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
or uttering a council of hatred
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.
I sometimes see
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces
because people often want to be right instead.
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
Now why was I so grateful to TED?
Because they took me very gently
from my book-lined study
and brought me into the 21st century,
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience
than I could have ever conceived.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
If we don't manage to implement
the Golden Rule globally,
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,
as though they were as important as ourselves,
I doubt that we'll have
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
The task of our time,
one of the great tasks of our time,
is to build a global society, as I said,
where people can live together in peace.
And the religions that should be making a major contribution
are instead seen as part of the problem.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
This is the source of all morality,
this imaginative act of empathy,
putting yourself in the place of another.
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,
or we can go back to
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,
who, when asked by a pagan
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that
any interpretation of scripture
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
And we need to revive that spirit.
And it's not just going to happen
because a spirit of love wafts us down.
We have to make this happen,
and we can do it
with the modern communications
that TED has introduced.
Already I've been tremendously heartened
at the response of all our partners.
In Singapore, we have a group
going to use the Charter to heal divisions
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,
and some members of the parliament want
to implement it politically.
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition
in which leading artists are going to be
taking people, young people,
and showing them that compassion also lies
at the root of all art.
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities
are holding events and discussions,
are discussing the centrality of compassion
in Islam and in all faiths.
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
Religious teaching must always lead to action.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners
to do two things --
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so
dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means
feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion
if you're just going to think about it.
You also have to do it.
I want them to get the media involved
because the media are crucial
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views
we have of other people,
which are dividing us from one another.
The same applies to educators.
I'd like youth to get a sense of
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge
of a compassionate lifestyle.
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,
not just a gooey feeling.
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore
the compassionate theme
in their own and in other people's traditions.
And perhaps above all,
to encourage a sensitivity about
uncompassionate speaking,
so that because people have this Charter,
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,
they feel empowered
to challenge uncompassionate speech,
disdainful remarks
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,
from the captains of industry.
Because we can change the world,
we have the ability.
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.
I was still stuck in the old world
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room
and issuing yet another arcane statement.
And TED introduced me to a whole new way
of thinking and presenting ideas.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
In this room, all this expertise,
if we joined it all together,
we could change the world.
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author
whom I don't quote very often,
C.S. Lewis.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
It's in his book "The Four Loves."
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
And then he compared that to friendship,
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.
We don't have to fall in love with each other,
but we can become friends.
And I am convinced.
I felt it very strongly
during our little deliberations at Vevey,
that when people of all different persuasions
come together, working side by side
for a common goal,
differences melt away.
And we learn amity.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
Thank you very much.

I draw to better understand things.
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings
and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff
and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know
that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,"
while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,
spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.
Who knew about extension managers?
I've always managed my own extensions
so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,
but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,
because along with the invitation
came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,
so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary
but some alternate form of communication would.
Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,
something that would be particularly appropriate
for many of the more technically minded people here,
or I could talk about something I really care about.
I decided to go with the latter.
I'm going to talk about Rome.
Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?
Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design
in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.
I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,
in Rome as a student. It changed my life.
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,
driving into RISD everyday, driving back.
I missed the '60s. I read about them; 
I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,
but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,
and it's a place that is never far from my mind.
So, whenever given an opportunity,
I try to do something in it or with it or for it.
I also make drawings to help people understand things.
Things that I want them to believe I understand.
And that's what I do as an illustrator,
that's my job.
So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.
I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.
These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --
I need to.
All different materials, all different styles, all different times,
drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.
Part of the reason I'm showing you these
is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through
of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.
These are sketches of some of the little details.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,
we're talking about narrow little winding streets
that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas --
never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new,
the bits of light that come down between the buildings
that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of
usually blue -- especially in the summer --
compared to the map that you would normally expect to see
of conventional streets.
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.
How could I share my sense of Rome,
my understanding of Rome?
And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when
if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there
with any kind of efficiency.
Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;
maybe I should just try and do a little atlas
of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.
And here's a line of text that actually evolves
from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain
in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.
Maybe that line of text could be a story
to help give some human aspect to this.
Maybe I should get away from this map completely,
and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome
and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --
which happens in so many of the squares in the city --
and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain
what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.
But even though I just started this presentation,
this is not the first thing that I tried to do
and I was getting sort of desperate.
Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,
so I decided to move towards packaging. 
I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.
But one of the ideas that emerged
from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome
in different vehicles at different speeds in order
to show the different aspects of Rome.
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.
Quick snapshots of things you might see
from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow
walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail
some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across.
Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.
Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions
so I could actually use it as a scale
that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.
This thing would be flying over or past
or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --
sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,
but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon
with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,
and so on and so forth. If you were interested.
This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,
she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --
she's assembling the structure,
Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps
and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.
Over the Spanish Steps we go.
A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.
Unfortunately, just across the road from it
or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,
as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around
the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure
of the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
which is really no more than a pile of quarters
high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,
completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside
a spectacular place to visit.
A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,
extraordinary blue sky.
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.
She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope
and climbs down for a closer look inside.
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced
to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view
and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,
getting a different kind of perspective,
moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building
that can contain perfectly a sphere
dimensions of the diameter being the same
as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus.
Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled
around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,
and they are immediately yanked out
and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour
of some of the domes of Rome, which would,
from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,
that little spiral structure you see there.
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,
is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,
which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket
and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,
which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,
and then is completely removed
and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.
Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.
Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,
Ajax makes a lunge for it.
She's managed to save the prosciutto,
but in the process she loses the tablecloth,
which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.
They continue without their tablecloth,
looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.
They eventually discover a huge wall
that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible
because you've got a place to tie up.
Turns out to be the exterior wall --
that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,
so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch
and have a spectacular view.
At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off
through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city
and then an abandoned gatehouse
and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,
which has this lightning rod on top.
Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,
and when you're in a dirigible
you have to be very careful about spikes.
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.
Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,
but he's not due at work until about noon.
So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.
He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city
past the church of Santa Maria della Pace,
down the alleys, through the streets
that tourists may be wandering through,
disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.
That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,
which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides
because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,
one of which is upside down in this image.
So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter
who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine
in a delicate white wine clam sauce
to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.
Waiter catches on, but it's too late.
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,
but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.
Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons
Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that
because of scaffolding and the determination
to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues
to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time
in which it finds itself, or we find it.
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda,
in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.
Marcello, as it turns out,
is the driver of the number 64 bus,
and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know
that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance
as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter.
And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.
He's looking at his table;
he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, 
and he wants it to be perfect.
He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle
and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.
But he's not happy; something's wrong.
The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,
but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.
Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,
actually; he's in television.
He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.
So they all have his number.
He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,
who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;
nobody's TVs are working
and there's a big soccer game coming up,
and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous.
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,
and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,
apartment by apartment, checking every television,
checking every connection,
hoping to find out what this problem is.
He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase
and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.
He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth
wrapped around the building's television antenna.
He removes it, the problems are solved,
everybody in the palazzo is happy.
And of course, he also solves his own problem.
All he has to do now, with a perfect table,
is wait for her to arrive.
That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough
to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.
So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,
and I'll get inside and underneath
and I'll show these things growing
and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.
And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,
I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces
and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,
so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius
and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.
Now that's one drawing,
so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. 
You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here
and also hope.
There's a very thin blue line of exhaust
that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.
Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?"
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,
it's a series of layers.
I mean, you always peel one layer off another;
we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.
But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --
horizontal layers, vertical layers --
and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --
if I got you thinking about it the right way --
would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome
covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change
as these structures have been adapted
rather than being torn down.
If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side
and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.
You can see that in 1635,
it became essential to make smaller windows
because the bad guys were coming or whatever.
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.
But more importantly, I could also show you
what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings
with all the massive stone blocks,
or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,
which is more often the case.
So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets
into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --
double foldout page -- which, if you were like me
reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.
You wrap the pages around your head
and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.
And I've really not done anything much more complicated
than make foldout pages.
But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.
Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.
Here's a book completely wide open.
OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,
if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,
and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.
And if I turn the book the other way,
we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.
No foldouts, no tricks --
just a book that isn't open the whole way.
That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside
and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.
So we get inside the Pantheon
and it grows and so on and so forth.
And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,
but it sort of lost its human quality.
So I went back to the notion of story,
which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people
to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.
Pigeon's Progress struck me as a catchy title.
If it was a homing pigeon,
it would be called "Homer's Odyssey."
But it was the journey of the ... 
I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome
and showed all the things that I like about Rome.
It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,
the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting
and there's no way this pigeon can get home.
So it's a homeless pigeon now
and it's going to have to find another place to live,
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,
and we start with the tall ones and so on.
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;
that's not always a good thing,
but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.
And I thought, that's sort of interesting,
but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way.
So I kind of came up with this old guy
who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.
He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --
and they become really friends with this guy,
and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.
There's a real bond that develops
between this old man and these pigeons.
But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.
He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --
he lives in this little garret --
and they spell his name and fly around.
And he finally gets enough strength together
to climb up the ladder onto the roof,
and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him
and they carry him off over the walls of the city.
And I forgot to mention this:
whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon
out beyond the walls of the city.
In the old Roman custom, the dead
were never buried within the walls.
And I thought that's a really cheery story.
. That's really going to go a long way.
So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work
and if the stories aren't going anywhere,
I just come up with titles
and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.
And sometimes it does focus me enough
and I'll even do a title page.
So, these are all title pages that eventually led me
to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman
who sends a message on a homing pigeon --
she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.
If you see the red line,
you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;
if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.
And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,
to try to convey what that sense would be like
of flying over the city without actually moving.
Past the Pyramid of Cestius --
these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --
past the gatehouse.
This is something that's a little bit unusual.
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:
it takes the scenic route,  which was a device
that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book
beyond about four pages.
So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin
and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --
designed by Michelangelo,
built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.
We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.
This is one of those things I show to my students
because it's a complete bastardization --
a denial of any rules of perspective.
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is
if it looks believable, you've succeeded.
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;
a couple are on Mars and
a couple of others in Cremona.
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,
where invariably a soccer game is going on,
and we're hit by a soccer ball.
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.
I have all the pieces:
there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,
there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,
so I had to rethink it.
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,
these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive --
just turn it around and look at it the other way.
Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --
one of the few remaining medieval towers --
towards the church of Sant'Agnese
and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --
which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;
there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --
and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,
stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus
of the Pantheon to catch our breath.
And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,
we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,
so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page.
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;
it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;
beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.
And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,
which is our destination.
Straight up through the courtyard
into a little window into the attic,
where somebody is working at the drawing board.
He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.
As we look at the drawing board,
we see what he's working on is, in fact,
a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,
and the red line extends through all the sights.
And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,
all you have to do is read these paragraphs.
Thank you very much.
Today I'd like to show you
the future of the way we make things.
I believe that soon our buildings and machines
will be self-assembling,
replicating and repairing themselves.
So I'm going to show you
what I believe is the current state of manufacturing,
and then compare that to some natural systems.
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers --
two and a half years [of assembly time],
500,000 to a million parts,
fairly complex,
new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.
We have exciting machines
that can take us into space --
five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,
we have proteins
that have two million types,
can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds,
or DNA with three billion base pairs
we can replicate in roughly an hour.
So there's all of this complexity
in our natural systems,
but they're extremely efficient,
far more efficient than anything we can build,
far more complex than anything we can build.
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.
They hardly ever make mistakes.
And they can repair themselves for longevity.
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.
And if we can translate that
into our built environment,
then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment,
I think there's four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode
all of the complexity of what we want to build --
so our buildings and machines.
And we need to decode that into simple sequences --
basically the DNA of how our buildings work.
Then we need programmable parts
that can take that sequence
and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate,
allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.
And we need some type of error correction redundancy
to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.
So I'm going to show you a number of projects
that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on
to achieve this self-assembling future.
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots --
8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into,
into a sequence of angles --
so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0,
120, negative 120 -- something like that;
so a sequence of angles, or turns,
and you send that sequence through the string.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 --
it rotates to that, checks if it got there
and then passes it to its neighbor.
So these are the brilliant scientists,
engineers, designers that worked on this project.
And I think it really brings to light:
Is this really scalable?
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours
made to make this eight-foot robot.
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?
The next one questions that
and looks at passive nature,
or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.
But it goes a step further,
and it tries to have actual computation.
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing,
the digital logic gate,
directly into your parts.
So this is a NAND gate.
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate
that's going to do your computing,
and you have two input tetrahedrons.
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.
So what this means
is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.
It computes on what it was doing before
and what you said you wanted it to do.
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space --
so up or down.
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.
On the right-hand side,
[0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.
And so what that really means
is that our structures now contain the blueprints
of what we want to build.
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.
In this case I call it self-guided replication,
because your structure contains the exact blueprints.
If you have errors, you can replace a part.
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it
and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains,
and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now
of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability
and programmability
and makes it a completely passive system.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical,
and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain,
it then folds up
into any configuration that you've programmed in --
so in this case, a spiral,
or in this case,
two cubes next to each other.
So you can basically program
any three-dimensional shape --
or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.
So what does this tell us about the future?
I think that it's telling us
that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair
in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.
There's new programmability in these parts.
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.
We'll have spatial computing.
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines,
all of our bricks could actually compute.
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power,
new design possibilities.
So it's exciting potential for this.
So I think these projects I've showed here
are just a tiny step towards this future,
if we implement these new technologies
for a new self-assembling world.
Thank you.

We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
So I'll try and do that, but
I want to start with two things that everyone already knows.
And the first one, in fact, is something that
has been known for most of recorded history.
And that is that the planet Earth, or the solar system,
or our environment or whatever,
is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought --
and our present existence, and most important, our future survival.
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship,
the universe is implacably hostile,
and inside is all we have, all we depend on.
And we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,
we've got nowhere else to go.
Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that
contrary to what was believed for most of human history,
human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence.
As Stephen Hawking famously said,
we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet
that's in orbit around a typical star,
which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on.
Now the first of those two things that everyone knows
is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place,
uniquely suited and so on, and
the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by
and to inform your life decisions,
then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other.
But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false. 
And they are. So let me start with the second one:
Typical. Well -- is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know,
and look in a random direction, and we see a wall, and chemical scum -- 
-- and that's not typical of the universe at all.
All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back,
and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all --
all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that,
you'll see the sun, the solar system, and the stars and so on.
But that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies.
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,
is nowhere near any galaxies.
So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back,
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
And at this point we've come 100,000 light years from here.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
To get to a typical place,
you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space.
And so what does that look like? Typical.
What does a typical place in the universe look like?
Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion
virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space
#NAME?
So can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it?
Well, not quite, not quite perfect -- you see, in intergalactic space
#NAME?
It's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you,
and that star were to explode as a supernova,
and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,
you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer.
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event,
that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years. 
And yet from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
It's also very cold out there
#NAME?
And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense
than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently
create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place.
And that is how un-typical this place is.
So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you.
Now how do we know about an environment that's so far away,
and so different, and so alien, from anything we're used to?
Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge.
Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been --
I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars.
They're called "quasars." Quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object.
Which means things that look a bit like stars.  But they're not stars.
And we know what they are. Billions of years ago, and billions of light years away,
the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a
super-massive black hole.
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of
that gravitational collapse. And some of the matter,
back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of
-- I think it's a trillion suns.
Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet.
We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down
when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,
but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time. 
And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later,
on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe,
and model, and predict, and explain, above all -- there's your reference
#NAME?
The one physical system, the brain,
contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,
but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical
relationships and the same causal structure.
Now that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough,
the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other
is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge.
So, the laws of physics have this special property.
That physical objects, as unlike each other as they could possibly be,
can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure
and to do it more and more so over time.
So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality.
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,
the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe,
is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the
whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant,
the fact that the laws of physics allow this, or even mandate that this can happen,
is one of the most important things about the physical world.
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment, in the form of us --
acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true,
but it's the wrong emphasis.  One thing that's true about it is that
it doesn't do it with any special physics. There's no special dispensation,
no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance.
One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of
information processing. Information processing is computation,
computation requires a computer --
there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important,
to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover.
And then thirdly, less tangible, but just as essential for the open-ended creation
of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence.
Now, our environment is inundated with evidence.
We happen to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity
about 300 years ago.
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter
of the Earth for billions of years before that, and will continue to fall on for billions of years
afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences.
As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths
of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet.
Our location is saturated with evidence, and also with matter and energy.
Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites
for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply.
As I said, it's empty; it's cold; and it's dark out there. Or is it?
Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception. 
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as
our home, the solar system. Now that cube is very empty by human standards,
but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,
on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an
open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on.
Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen
from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on.
But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe,
if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,
then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
And the same -- well, if we could do that we'd automatically have an energy supply,
because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence?
Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses. But all you've got to do is
take a telescope, even one of present-day design,
look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here.
And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars, and planets.
In those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics, and learn the laws of physics.
And locally there you could build particle accelerators,
and learn elementary particle physics, and chemistry, and so on.
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips --  -- because it would take
several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back.
But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard --
but I never did like biology field trips much,
and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years.

So in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended
creation of knowledge. Any such cube, anywhere in the universe,
could become the same kind of hub that we are,
if the knowledge of how to do so were present there.
So we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations,
then so is almost every other environment. So is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth.
And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources, because they're plentiful,
but knowledge, which is scarce.
Now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and I think ought to
-- make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable,
because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive
the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them.
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away, and we'll all be dead!
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things,
from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,
and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century.
I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference.
Now I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in.
But I do agree with him about this. We can survive, and we can fail to survive.
But it depends not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time.
The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time.
Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations
that have ever existed are now history.
And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically our only hope
is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species,
and our civilization, from all the others --
namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence.
So let me now apply this to a current controversy,
not because I want to advocate any particular solution,
but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean.
And the controversy is global warming.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming,
I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously
the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory,
it's already too late to avoid a disaster.
Because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity
and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is,
then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it
probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
It was probably already too late in the 1970s,
when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions
were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die.
Now the lesson of that seems clear to me,
and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate.
It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster,
and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,
then there's not going to be much argument, really.
But no precautions, and no precautionary principle,
can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,
but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not
consist of teaching you how to avoid punches. 
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only,
then it would achieve very little of either.
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions
in gas emissions at all costs.
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature,
and with plans to live at the higher temperature --
and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist,
things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away,
and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide.
At the moment, these things are fringe research.
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem, or problems in general.
And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right --
not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope,
not just of solving problems, but of survival.
So take two stone tablets, and carve on them.
On one of them, carve: "Problems are soluble."
And on the other one carve: "Problems are inevitable."
Thank you. 
At the break, I was asked by several people
about my comments about the aging debate.
And this will be my only comment on it.
And that is, I understand
that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.

What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is
how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code
to the first stages of beginning
to write the code ourselves.
It's only 10 years ago this month
when we published the first sequence
of a free-living organism,
that of haemophilus influenzae.
That took a genome project
from 13 years down to four months.
We can now do that same genome project
in the order of
two to eight hours.
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:
most human pathogens,
a couple of plants,
several insects and several mammals,
including the human genome.
Genomics at this stage of the thinking
from a little over 10 years ago
was, by the end of this year, we might have
between three and five genomes sequenced;
it's on the order of several hundred.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
to sequence 130 genomes this year,
as a side project from environmental organisms.
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
But as we look, what's out there,
we've barely scratched the surface
on what is available on this planet.
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible,
but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
whereas all animals only make up about
one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
but if you ever make it to the sea,
and you swallow a mouthful of seawater,
keep in mind that each milliliter
has about a million bacteria
and on the order of 10 million viruses.
Less than 5,000 microbial species
have been characterized as of two years ago,
and so we decided to do something about it.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,
where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,
trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
We started in Bermuda for our test project,
then moved up to Halifax,
working down the U.S. East Coast,
the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,
through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,
and we're in the process now of working our way
across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
in part to help excite young people
about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
We just take seawater and we filter it,
and we collect different size organisms on different filters,
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
where we can sequence a hundred million letters
of the genetic code every 24 hours.
And with doing this,
we've made some amazing discoveries.
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments
that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms
in the environment that had these same pigments.
It turns out, almost every species
in the upper parts of the ocean
in warm parts of the world
have these same photoreceptors,
and use sunlight as the source of their energy
and communication.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater,
we discovered 1.3 million new genes
and as many as 50,000 new species.
We've extended this to the air
now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria
all of us are breathing in and out every day,
particularly on airplanes
or closed auditoriums.

We filter through some simple apparatuses;
we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that
at the present time.
Just on the data collection side,
just where we are through the Galapagos,
we're finding that almost every 200 miles,
we see tremendous diversity
in the samples in the ocean.
Some of these make logical sense,
in terms of different temperature gradients.
So this is a satellite photograph
based on temperatures -- red being warm,
blue being cold --
and we found there's a tremendous difference between
the warm water samples and the cold water samples,
in terms of abundant species.
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit
is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,
and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
And these vary tremendously from region to region.
Maybe not surprisingly,
in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,
the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around,
they see a lot of green light.
But they vary even more,
possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet
in the extremes.
Just to try and get an assessment
of what our gene repertoire was,
we assembled all the data --
including all of ours thus far from the expedition,
which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --
and it totaled around 29 million genes.
And we tried to put these into gene families
to see what these discoveries are:
Are we just discovering new members of known families,
or are we discovering new families?
And it turns out we have about 50,000
major gene families,
but every new sample we take in the environment
adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery
about basic genes,
components and life on this planet.
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,
we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
Of those roughly 29 million genes,
we only have around 24,000
in our genome.
And if you take all animals together,
we probably share less than 30,000
and probably maybe a dozen
or more thousand different gene families.
I view that these genes are now
not only the design components of evolution.
And we think in a gene-centric view --
maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --
than in a genome-centric view,
which are different constructs of these gene components.
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,
has changed at sort of the same pace
that DNA sequencing has
over the last decade or two,
and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came
when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
And we have really nice T-shirts that say,
you know, "I heart my genitalium."
This is actually just a microorganism.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
And we simply asked the question,
if one species needs 800, another 500,
is there a smaller set of genes
that might comprise a minimal operating system?
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA
that randomly insert in the genetic code.
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
So we made a map of all the genes
that could take transposon insertions
and we called those "non-essential genes."
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
and you can only
define an essential or non-essential gene
based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
with the genomes of 13 related organisms,
and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
common to all 13 organisms.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
one intracellular parasite;
it expanded even more
when we looked at core sets of genes
of around 310 or so.
So we think that we can expand
or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
to maybe 300 to 400 genes
from the minimal of 500.
The only way to prove these ideas
was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA
in large pieces was extremely difficult.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
developed an exciting new method
that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
in only a two-week period
that was 100 percent accurate,
in terms of its sequence and its biology.
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
This was not the first synthetic virus --
a polio virus had been made a year before --
but it was only one ten-thousandth as active
and it took three years to do.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
and that's the notions that we have with biology.
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,
and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
and a special committee the U.S. government has set up
to review this area.
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
versus what happens with people's imaginations.
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today --
that genome can be made.
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome,
that DNA itself would not cause infections.
The real concern that security departments have
is designer viruses.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
that had major efforts
on trying to create biological warfare agents.
If that research is truly discontinued,
there should be very little activity
on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
And possibly eukaryotic cells,
those that we have,
are possible within a decade.
So we're now making several dozen different constructs,
because we can vary the cassettes and the genes
that go into this artificial chromosome.
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
We start with these fragments,
and then we have a homologous recombination system
that reassembles those into a chromosome.
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,
that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst
in about 12 to 24 hours,
after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet,
and exists perhaps now
in outer space due to all our travel there.
This is a glass beaker after
about half a million rads of radiation.
The glass started to burn and crack,
while the microbes sitting in the bottom
just got happier and happier.
Here's an actual picture of what happens:
the top of this shows the genome
after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
The chromosome is literally blown apart.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled
24 hours later.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
and we probably have thousands,
if not tens of thousands, of different species
on this planet that are capable of doing that.
After these genomes are synthesized,
the first step is just transplanting them
into a cell without a genome.
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,
not only for understanding the basis of biology
but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
For example, from the third organism we sequenced,
Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;
its energy source is hydrogen
and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
So we know lots of different pathways,
thousands of different organisms now
that live off of CO2,
and can capture that back.
So instead of using carbon from oil
for synthetic processes,
we have the chance of using carbon
and capturing it back from the atmosphere,
converting that into biopolymers
or other products.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
and we use as a reducing power
to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
Also, there's numerous pathways
that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
to capture and convert the methane
from the gas fields there into useful products.
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field
called "Combinatorial Genomics,"
because with these new synthesis capabilities,
these vast gene array repertoires
and the homologous recombination,
we think we can design a robot to make
maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And therefore, as with all biology,
you get selection through screening,
whether you're screening for hydrogen production,
or chemical production, or just viability.
To understand the role of these genes
is going to be well within reach.
We're trying to modify photosynthesis
to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,
and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase
that we think will totally change this process.
We're also combining cellulases,
the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
and fermentation in the same cell
for producing ethanol.
Pharmaceutical production is already under way
in major laboratories
using microbes.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment
is orders of magnitude more complex
than our best chemists can produce.
I think future engineered species
could be the source of food,
hopefully a source of energy,
environmental remediation
and perhaps
replacing the petrochemical industry.
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review
as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
Every major religion participated in this.
It was actually a very strange study,
because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
were biological warfare aspects of this,
but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
for the reasons we were doing them.
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded
a multi-institutional study on this,
to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
and the rules that scientific teams such as my own
should be using in this area,
and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
These are complex issues.
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism,
they're very simple issues in terms of,
can we design things to produce clean energy,
perhaps revolutionizing
what developing countries can do
and provide through various simple processes.
Thank you very much.
Take a look at this picture.
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
These African students are doing their homework
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city
because they don't have any electricity at home.
Now, I haven't met these particular students,
but I've met students like them.
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
So here is the puzzle.
Why is it that Nelson has access
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology
for generating electric light in the home?
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available
when people can bring new technologies in
and make them available to someone like Nelson.
What kinds of rules?
The electric company in this nation
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell
electricity at a very low, subsidized price --
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,
to hook up many other users.
The president wanted to change this rule.
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
rules where businesses earn a small profit,
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
The president has seen how those rules worked well.
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
but ran into a firestorm of protest
from businesses and consumers
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him
from letting the win-win solution help his country.
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out
how we can change rules.
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight
that we can make practical,
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,
and more choices to leaders --
who, in many countries, are also people.

But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,
a choice like giving the president the choice
to raise prices on electricity,
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming
subsidized electric power.
So if you give just to one side or the other,
you'll have tension or friction.
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,
that will give us a set of rules
for changing rules that get us out of traps.
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.
And he says that if you want to see
the damaging effects of rules,
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
In particular check out Asia.
If you zoom in here,
you can see North Korea, in outline here,
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
Now, you won't be surprised to learn
that the rules in North Korea
keep people there in the dark.
But it is important to recognize
that North Korea and South Korea
started out with identical sets of rules
in both the sense of laws and regulations,
but also in the deeper senses of understandings,
norms, culture, values and beliefs.
When they separated, they made choices
that led to very divergent paths
for their sets of rules.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules
that we use to interact with each other,
for better, or for worse.
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.
Zoom in on Haiti,
in outline here.
Haiti is also dark,
compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,
which has about the same number of residents.
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,
which has half as many residents
as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
What Haiti warns us is that
rules can be bad because governments are weak.
It's not just that the rules are bad because
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,
we can't just tear down.
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.
Now, China dramatically demonstrates
both the potential and the challenges
of working with rules.
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,
China was the world's high-technology leader.
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
And they soon adopted rules which
slowed down innovation
and cut China off from the rest of the world.
So as other countries in the world innovated,
in the sense both of developing
newer technologies,
but also developing newer rules,
the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Income there stayed stagnant,
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
It plots income, average income in China
as a percentage of average income in the United States.
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
But then in the late '70s something changed.
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up
very quickly with the United States.
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
The brightest spot in China,
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,
is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong was a small bit of China
that, for most of the 20th century,
operated under a very different set of rules
than the rest of mainland China --
rules that were copied
from working market economies of the time,
and administered by the British.
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where
millions of people could go, from the mainland,
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
But, to get on a process of increasing income,
increasing skills
led to very rapid growth there.
Hong Kong was also the model
which leaders like Deng Xiaoping
could copy, when they decided to move
all of the mainland towards the market model.
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood
the importance of offering choices to his people.
So instead of forcing everyone in China
to shift immediately to the market model,
they proceeded by creating some special zones
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
zones where Chinese could come and work,
and cities grew up very rapidly there;
also zones where foreign firms could come in
and make things.
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm
that made the iPhone that many of you have,
and they made it with labor from Chinese
who moved there to Shenzhen.
So after the four special zones,
there were 14 coastal cites
that were open in the same sense,
and eventually demonstrated successes
in these places that people could opt in to,
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.
One is: preserve choices for people.
Two: operate on the right scale.
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,
but a village would be too small
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people
all working under good rules.
On the other hand, the nation is too big.
If you try to change the rules in the nation,
you can't give some people a chance
to hold back, see how things turn out,
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
But cities give you this opportunity
to create new places,
with new rules that people can opt in to.
And they're large enough
to get all of the benefits that we can have
when millions of us work together under good rules.
So the proposal is that we
conceive of something called a charter city.
We start with a charter that specifies
all the rules required
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
We'll need to attract the investors
who will build out the infrastructure --
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
You'll need to attract firms,
who will come hire the people who move there first.
And you'll need to attract families,
the residents who will come and live there permanently,
raise their children, get an education for their children,
and get their first job.
With that charter, people will move there.
The city can be built.
And we can scale this model.
We can go do it over and over again.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
Those are captured in the charter.
We also need the choices for people.
That's really built into the model
if we allow for the possibility of building cities
on uninhabited land.
You start from uninhabited territory.
People can come live under the new charter,
but no one is forced to live under it.
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
cases where nations work together,
in effect, de facto,
the way China and Britain worked together
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,
and then scale it throughout China.
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,
through its actions in Hong Kong,
did more to reduce world poverty
than all the aid programs that we've undertaken
in the last century.
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships
to replicate this again,
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,
a delegation of control from one country to another
to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.
Now, when I say that,
some of you are starting to think,
Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions
that come up when we start to think about these things,
can get in the way, can make us pull back,
can shut down our ability,
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
Why is this not like colonialism?
The thing that was bad about colonialism,
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,
is that it involved elements of
coercion and condescension.
This model is all about choices,
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
It must have occurred to Castro
that he has the chance to do for Cuba
what Deng Xiaoping did for China,
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south
that has a very special status.
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,
where a treaty gives the United States
administrative responsibility
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
They want to get out.
Why don't you, Canada, take over?
Build -- run a special administrative zone.
Allow a new city to be built up there.
Allow many people to come in.
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Others will hold back. But this will be
the gateway that will connect
the modern economy and the modern world
to my country."
Now, where else might this model be tried?
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone
that people can opt into as a rule.
It's a rule for changing rules.
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
They also totally get the idea that in some instances
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --
the kind of investors who will come build the port,
build the roads, in a new city --
they can make more credible promises
if they do it along with a partner nation.
Perhaps even in some arrangement
that's a little bit like an escrow account,
where you put land in the escrow account
and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
There is also lots of land in Africa
where new cities could be built.
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
There are immense stretches of land like this --
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.
Now, if we generalize this and think about
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --
cities that will help create places for the
many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people
who will move to cities in the coming century --
is there enough land for them?
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks
like most of the world is already built out.
So let me show you why that's wrong.
Take this representation of all of the land.
Turn it into a square that stands for
all the arable land on Earth.
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up
by the cities that three billion people now live in.
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,
they would be dots like this.
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth
by building more cities that people can move to.
And if these are cities governed by good rules,
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,
safe from disease and bad sanitation,
where people have a chance to get a job.
They can get basic utilities like electricity.
Their kids can get an education.
So what will it take to get started
building the first charter cities,
scaling this so we build many more?
It would help to have a manual.

What university professors could do
is write some details that might go into this manual.
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,
go out and design them.
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. 
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,
suppose it isn't just Canada
that does the deal with Raul Castro.
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
How would we write the treaty to do that?
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
How would we finance this?
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong
are cities that made huge gains
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
You could use the gains on the value of the land
to pay for things like the police, the courts,
but the school system and the health care system too,
which make this a more attractive place to live,
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --
which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone
and build it, and set up the basic rules,
go very much in the right direction.
So there are many other details like this.
How could we have buildings that are
low cost and affordable for people who work
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
but make those buildings energy efficient,
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down
in an earthquake or a hurricane.
Many technical details to be worked out,
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things
can already tell that there is no roadblock,
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,
that will keep us from delivering on
a truly global win-win solution.
Let me conclude with this picture.
The reason we can be so well off,
even though there is so many people on earth,
is because of the power of ideas.
We can share ideas with other people,
and when they discover them, they share with us.
It's not like scarce objects,
where sharing means we each get less.
When we share ideas we all get more.
When we think about ideas in that way,
we usually think about technologies.
But there is another class of ideas:
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;
rules like, let's have a tax system
that supports a research university
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land
that is registered in a government office,
that people can pledge as collateral.
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,
and particularly innovate in the sense
of coming up with rules for changing rules,
so we don't get stuck with bad rules,
then we can keep moving progress forward
and truly make the world a better place,
so that people like Nelson and his friends
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

I want to share with you
some ideas about the secret power of time,
in a very short time.

Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation
of the principals in Adam's temptation.
Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite. "I did."
One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve.
I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
Okay. One bite. What the hell?

Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,
yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,
present focus and future focus.
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --
thank you George Bush --
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
And most of them did so without using birth control.
So much for promises.
Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,
went back 14 years later,
to try to discover what was different about those kids.
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted
and kids who yielded, in many ways.
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,
the key for you,
is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.
So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals,
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience
into time zones or time categories.
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
They vary between cultures, between nations,
between individuals, between social classes,
between education levels.
And the problem is that they can become biased,
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
What determines any decision you make?
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --
we're going to call them "present-oriented,"
because their focus is what is now.
For others, the present is irrelevant.
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
So that their decisions are based on past memories.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
For others it's not the past, it's not the present,
it's only about the future.
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.
Cost-benefit analysis.
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
So, time paradox, I want to argue,
the paradox of time perspective,
is something that influences every decision you make,
you're totally unaware of.
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these
biased time perspectives.
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
You can be present-hedonistic,
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.
Or you can be transcendental future:
namely, life begins after death.
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly
depending on the demands of the situation,
that's what you've got to learn to do.
So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.
And moderate on present-hedonism.
And always low on past-negative
and present-fatalism.
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
What you get from the future is wings
to soar to new destinations, new challenges.
What you get from the present hedonism
is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,
places, people, sensuality.
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
What do futures sacrifice for success?
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
And they live for work, achievement and control.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.

And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.
I'm here as a future-oriented person
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices
because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
Told me don't eat that marshmallow,
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,
until I learned to balance out.
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,
and I'm happier than I have ever been.
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:
changing the drop-out rates of school kids,
combating addictions, enhancing teen health,
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --
promoting sustainability and conservation,
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,
altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,
and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.
So I want to end by saying:
many of life's puzzles can be solved
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
And the idea is so simple, so obvious,
but I think the consequences are really profound.
Thank you so much.

In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
the body formerly known as a planet.
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,
to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,
and we, living on it, came to be.
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
and search for answers to questions like this,
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --
we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor
for a much larger human voyage
to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,
and also how humans fit into that picture.
And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition
that we are conducting around Saturn,
and have been for the past two and a half years.
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
and, until Cassini had arrived there,
was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain
that we had remaining in our solar system.
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere,
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
except that its atmosphere is suffused with
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
But these haze particles, it was surmised,
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
in a thick organic sludge.
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere,
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,
it might be raining, and you might be standing
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. 
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,
and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
And yet another moon there --
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And we have taken pictures like this.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
When you look closer at this region, you start to see things
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
meaning it's a very young surface.
And there are features that look tectonic.
They look like they've been pulled apart.
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And so it's been tectonically altered.
But we couldn't make sense of our images,
until, six months after we got into orbit,
an event occurred that many have regarded
as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making,
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind,
this was an event that should have been celebrated
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
and sadly, that wasn't the case.
.
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words
united nations are supposed to mean:
a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
and to come to understand a planetary system
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
and now humans had actually touched it.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
It was a tremendously emotional event,
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
.
But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
and it also took panoramic pictures.
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And you can follow these channels
and you can see how they all converge.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
You are looking at a shoreline.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
you would be flying at these altitudes.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
as you fly across the surface of Titan. 
And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
.
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
What the probe came down in was basically
the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
And it's probably the case that this material
has washed off the highlands of Titan
through these channels that we saw,
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
But still, there was no sign in our images,
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
separated by a few kilometers,
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And then, only a week and a half ago,
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan
is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,
and having Earth-like geological formations
and a tremendous geographical diversity,
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
.
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
It is a very geologically active body.
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --
where we found this system of fractures.
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
extending hundreds of miles into space.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
we see that these jets feed a plume
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
into the space above Enceladus.
My team and I have examined images like this,
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And we have arrived at the conclusion
that these jets may be erupting from pockets
of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
elsewhere in our solar system,
whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,
would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
It is precious, it is unique,
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --
you would remember this very famous picture
taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
you see the refracted image of the Sun
and you see this ring created, in fact,
by the exhalations of Enceladus.
But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,
sight of our own planet,
cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
Now, there is something deeply moving
about seeing ourselves from afar,
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
in the skies of other worlds.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
And thank you very much.

We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out
three and a half million news stories a year.
That's just one source.
My question is: How many of those stories
are actually going to matter in the long run?
That's the idea behind The Long News.
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,
which was founded by TEDsters including
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
And when you look at the news through that filter,
a lot falls by the wayside.
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,
is this going to matter in a decade?
Or this?
Or this?
Really?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
Okay, that was kind of cool.

But the top story of this past year was the economy,
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,
this particular recession is going to be old news.
So, what kind of stories might
make a difference for the future?
Well, let's take science.
Someday, little robots will go
through our bloodstreams fixing things.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
Some recent stories:
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;
they're sending genes into the brain;
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
What about global politics?
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,
and they may.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids
to choose their careers.
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.
Some recent discoveries:
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now
spread to every continent but Antarctica;
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --
soon, science may no longer need us,
and life may no longer need us either;
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
It seems that with or without us,
life will go on.
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year
was this one: water found on the moon.
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,
or somebody in this room might write a big check.
My point is this:
In the long run, some news stories
are more important than others.

In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,
it is hard to believe
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem
that the majority of the world's populous faces:
not having detailed maps.
But help was coming.
At Google, 40 volunteers
used a new software
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us
to map what we know locally.
People have used this software
to map everything from roads to rivers,
from schools to local businesses,
and video stores to the corner store.
Maps matter.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto
recognized that the key to economic liftoff
for most developing countries
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
In the last year alone,
thousands of users in 170 countries
have mapped millions of pieces of information,
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by
the power of passionate users everywhere.
Let's look at some of the maps
being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

Welcome to the new world.

I'm a filmmaker.
For the last 8 years,
I have dedicated my life
to documenting the work
of Israelis and Palestinians
who are trying to end the conflict
using peaceful means.
When I travel with my work
across Europe and the United States,
one question always comes up:
Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
Why aren't Palestinians
using nonviolent resistance?
The challenge I face when I hear this question
is that often I have just returned from the Middle East
where I spent my time
filming dozens of Palestinians
who are using nonviolence
to defend their lands
and water resources
from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
These leaders are trying to forge
a massive national nonviolent movement
to end the occupation
and build peace in the region.
Yet, most of you
have probably never heard about them.
This divide between what's happening on the ground
and perceptions abroad
is one of the key reasons
why we don't have yet
a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement
that has been successful.
So I'm here today
to talk about the power of attention,
the power of your attention,
and the emergence and development
of nonviolent movements
in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --
but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
I believe that what's mostly missing
for nonviolence to grow
is not for Palestinians
to start adopting nonviolence,
but for us to start paying attention
to those who already are.
Allow me to illustrate this point
by taking you to this village
called Budrus.
About seven years ago,
they faced extinction,
because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,
and part of this barrier
would be built on top of the village.
They would lose 40 percent of their land
and be surrounded,
so they would lose free access
to the rest of the West Bank.
Through inspired local leadership,
they launched a peaceful resistance campaign
to stop that from happening.
Let me show you some brief clips,
so you have a sense
for what that actually looked like on the ground.

Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall
would separate Palestine from Israel.
Here in Budrus,
we realized the wall would steal our land.
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,
created a solution to terror.
Man: Today you're invited
to a peaceful march.
You are joined
by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army
more than nonviolent opposition.
Woman: We saw the men
trying to push the soldiers,
but none of them could do that.
But I think the girls could do it.
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds
of traditional thinking.
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,
and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
Chanting: One united nation.
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
They were allowed to use any force necessary.

Man: These are live bullets.
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest
is not going to stop the [unclear].
Protester: This is a peaceful march.
There is no need to use violence.
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
We can do it!
Julia Bacha: When I first heard
about the story of Budrus,
I was surprised
that the international media had failed to cover
the extraordinary set of events
that happened seven years ago,
in 2003.
What was even more surprising
was the fact that Budrus was successful.
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,
convinced the Israeli government
to move the route of the barrier off their lands
and to the green line,
which is the internationally recognized boundary
between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
The resistance in Budrus
has since spread
to villages across the West Bank
and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
Yet the media remains mostly silent
on these stories.
This silence carries profound consequences
for the likelihood
that nonviolence can grow,
or even survive,
in Palestine.
Violent resistance
and nonviolent resistance
share one very important thing in common;
they are both a form of theater
seeking an audience to their cause.
If violent actors
are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers
and attracting international attention
to the Palestinian issue,
it becomes very hard
for nonviolent leaders
to make the case to their communities
that civil disobedience
is a viable option
in addressing their plight.
The power of attention
is probably going to come as no surprise
to the parents in the room.
The surest way
to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums
is by giving him attention
the first time he throws a fit.
The tantrum will become
what childhood psychologists call
a functional behavior,
since the child has learned
that he can get parental attention out of it.
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior
simply by giving or withdrawing
attention to their children.
But that's true for adults too.
In fact, the behavior
of entire communities and countries
can be influenced,
depending on where
the international community chooses
to focus its attention.
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East
and bringing peace
is for us
to transform nonviolence
into a functional behavior
by giving a lot more attention
to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
In the course of taking my film to villages
in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,
I have seen the impact
that even one documentary film can have
in influencing the transformation.
In a village called Wallajeh,
which sits very close to Jerusalem,
the community was facing
a very similar plight to Budrus.
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands
and not have freedom of access,
either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
They had been using nonviolence for about two years
but had grown disenchanted
since nobody was paying attention.
So we organized a screening.
A week later,
they held the most well-attended
and disciplined
demonstration to date.
The organizers say
that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus
documented in a film,
felt that there were indeed people
following what they were doing,
that people cared.
So they kept on going.
On the Israeli side,
there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,
which means solidarity in Hebrew.
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus
as one of their primary recruiting tools.
They report
that Israelis who had never been active before,
upon seeing the film,
understand the power of nonviolence
and start joining their activities.
The examples of Wallajeh
and the Solidariot movement
show that even a small-budget independent film
can play a role
in transforming nonviolence
into a functional behavior.
Now imagine the power
that big media players could have
if they started covering
the weekly nonviolent demonstrations
happening in villages
like Bil'in, Ni'lin,
Wallajeh,
in Jerusalem neighborhoods
like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --
the nonviolent leaders
would become more visible,
valued and effective
in their work.
I believe
that the most important thing
is to understand
that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,
they are invisible,
and it's as if they never happened.
But I have seen first hand
that if we do,
they will multiply.
If they multiply,
their influence will grow
in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
And theirs is the kind of influence
that can finally
unblock the situation.
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works
in places like Budrus.
Let's give them attention
so they can prove it works everywhere.
Thank you.

How do you explain when
things don't go as we assume?
Or better, how do you explain
when others are able to achieve things
that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
For example:
Why is Apple so innovative?
Year after year, after year, after year,
they're more innovative than all their competition.
And yet, they're just a computer company.
They're just like everyone else.
They have the same access to the same talent,
the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.
Then why is it that they
seem to have something different?
Why is it that Martin Luther King
led the Civil Rights Movement?
He wasn't the only man
who suffered in a pre-civil rights America,
and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.
Why him?
And why is it that the Wright brothers
were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight
when there were certainly other teams who were
better qualified, better funded ...
and they didn't achieve powered man flight,
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
There's something else at play here.
About three and a half years ago
I made a discovery.
And this discovery profoundly changed
my view on how I thought the world worked,
and it even profoundly changed the way in which
I operate in it.
As it turns out, there's a pattern.
As it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders
and organizations in the world --
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers --
they all think, act and communicate
the exact same way.
And it's the complete opposite
to everyone else.
All I did was codify it,
and it's probably the world's
simplest idea.
I call it the golden circle.
Why? How? What?
This little idea explains
why some organizations and some leaders
are able to inspire where others aren't.
Let me define the terms really quickly.
Every single person, every single organization on the planet
knows what they do,
100 percent.
Some know how they do it,
whether you call it your differentiated value proposition
or your proprietary process or your USP.
But very, very few people or organizations
know why they do what they do.
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
That's a result. It's always a result.
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
What's your cause? What's your belief?
Why does your organization exist?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
And why should anyone care?
Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act,
the way we communicate is from the outside in.
It's obvious. We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.
But the inspired leaders
and the inspired organizations --
regardless of their size, regardless of their industry --
all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.
Let me give you an example.
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
If Apple were like everyone else,
a marketing message from them might sound like this:
We make great computers.
They're beautifully designed, simple to use
and user friendly.
Want to buy one?" "Meh."
And that's how most of us communicate.
That's how most marketing is done, that's how most sales is done
and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally.
We say what we do, we say how we're different or how we're better
and we expect some sort of a behavior,
a purchase, a vote, something like that.
Here's our new law firm:
We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients,
we always perform for our clients who do business with us.
Here's our new car:
It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats, buy our car.
But it's uninspiring.
Here's how Apple actually communicates.
Everything we do,
we believe in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.
The way we challenge the status quo
is by making our products beautifully designed,
simple to use and user friendly.
We just happen to make great computers.
Want to buy one?"
Totally different right? You're ready to buy a computer from me.
All I did was reverse the order of the information.
What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;
people buy why you do it.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
This explains why
every single person in this room
is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
But we're also perfectly comfortable
buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,
or a DVR from Apple.
But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.
There's nothing that distinguishes them
structurally from any of their competitors.
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.
In fact, they tried.
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.
They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs.
They've been making flat screen monitors for years.
Nobody bought one.
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
and they make great quality products,
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --
and nobody bought one.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine
buying an MP3 player from Dell.
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?
But we do it every day.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
The goal is not to do business
with everybody who needs what you have.
The goal is to do business with people
who believe what you believe.
Here's the best part:
None of what I'm telling you is my opinion.
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
Not psychology, biology.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down,
what you see is the human brain is actually broken
into three major components
that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
our neocortex,
corresponds with the "what" level.
The neocortex is responsible for all of our
rational and analytical thought
and language.
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,
like trust and loyalty.
It's also responsible for all human behavior,
all decision-making,
and it has no capacity for language.
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in,
yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information
like features and benefits and facts and figures.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
When we can communicate from the inside out,
we're talking directly to the part of the brain
that controls behavior,
and then we allow people to rationalize it
with the tangible things we say and do.
This is where gut decisions come from.
You know, sometimes you can give somebody
all the facts and figures,
and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say,
but it just doesn't feel right."
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making
doesn't control language.
And the best we can muster up is, "I don't know. It just doesn't feel right."
Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart,
or you're leading with your soul.
Well, I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts
controlling your behavior.
It's all happening here in your limbic brain,
the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
But if you don't know why you do what you do,
and people respond to why you do what you do,
then how will you ever get people
to vote for you, or buy something from you,
or, more importantly, be loyal
and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;
the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
The goal is not just to hire people
who need a job;
it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
I always say that, you know,
if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money,
but if you hire people who believe what you believe,
they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
And nowhere else is there a better example of this
than with the Wright brothers.
Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
And back in the early 20th century,
the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
Everybody was trying it.
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,
to be the recipe for success.
I mean, even now, you ask people,
Why did your product or why did your company fail?
and people always give you the same permutation
of the same three things:
under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
Samuel Pierpont Langley
was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department
to figure out this flying machine.
Money was no problem.
He held a seat at Harvard
and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;
he knew all the big minds of the day.
He hired the best minds
money could find
and the market conditions were fantastic.
The New York Times followed him around everywhere,
and everyone was rooting for Langley.
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio,
Orville and Wilbur Wright,
they had none of what we consider
to be the recipe for success.
They had no money;
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;
not a single person on the Wright brothers' team
had a college education,
not even Orville or Wilbur;
and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
The difference was,
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
by a purpose, by a belief.
They believed that if they
could figure out this flying machine,
it'll change the course of the world.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
He was in pursuit of the result.
He was in pursuit of the riches.
And lo and behold, look what happened.
The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream
worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.
The others just worked for the paycheck.
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,
they would have to take five sets of parts,
because that's how many times they would crash
before they came in for supper.
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,
the Wright brothers took flight,
and no one was there to even experience it.
We found out about it a few days later.
And further proof that Langley
was motivated by the wrong thing:
The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.
He could have said,
That's an amazing discovery, guys,
and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,
he didn't get famous so he quit.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
And if you talk about what you believe,
you will attract those who believe what you believe.
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation,
and if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.
The first two and a half percent of our population
are our innovators.
The next 13 and a half percent of our population
are our early adopters.
The next 34 percent are your early majority,
your late majority and your laggards.
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones
is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.

We all sit at various places at various times on this scale,
but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us
is that if you want mass-market success
or mass-market acceptance of an idea,
you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point
between 15 and 18 percent market penetration,
and then the system tips.
And I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
And they love to tell you, "Oh, it's about 10 percent," proudly.
Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.
We all have about 10 percent who just "get it."
That's how we describe them, right?
That's like that gut feeling, "Oh, they just get it."
The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it
before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it?
So it's this here, this little gap
that you have to close,
as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --
because, you see, the early majority
will not try something
until someone else
has tried it first.
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,
they're comfortable making those gut decisions.
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions
that are driven by what they believe about the world
and not just what product is available.
These are the people who stood in line for six hours
to buy an iPhone when they first came out,
when you could have just walked into the store the next week
and bought one off the shelf.
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars
on flat screen TVs when they first came out,
even though the technology was substandard.
And, by the way, they didn't do it
because the technology was so great;
they did it for themselves.
It's because they wanted to be first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it
and what you do simply
proves what you believe.
In fact, people will do the things
that prove what they believe.
The reason that person bought the iPhone
in the first six hours,
stood in line for six hours,
was because of what they believed about the world,
and how they wanted everybody to see them:
They were first.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
So let me give you a famous example,
a famous failure and a famous success
of the law of diffusion of innovation.
First, the famous failure.
It's a commercial example.
As we said before, a second ago,
the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions,
right? You should have success then.
Look at TiVo.
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago
to this current day,
they are the single highest-quality product on the market,
hands down, there is no dispute.
They were extremely well-funded.
Market conditions were fantastic.
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
But TiVo's a commercial failure.
They've never made money.
And when they went IPO,
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars
and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,
except for a couple of little spikes.
Because you see, when TiVo launched their product
they told us all what they had.
They said, "We have a product that pauses live TV,
skips commercials, rewinds live TV
and memorizes your viewing habits
without you even asking."
And the cynical majority said,
We don't believe you.
We don't need it. We don't like it.
You're scaring us."
What if they had said,
If you're the kind of person
who likes to have total control
over every aspect of your life,
boy, do we have a product for you.
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it,
and what you do simply serves as
the proof of what you believe.
Now let me give you a successful example
of the law of diffusion of innovation.
In the summer of 1963,
250,000 people showed up
on the mall in Washington
to hear Dr. King speak.
They sent out no invitations,
and there was no website to check the date.
How do you do that?
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America
who was a great orator.
He wasn't the only man in America who suffered
in a pre-civil rights America.
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.
But he had a gift.
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
He went around and told people what he believed.
I believe, I believe, I believe,
he told people.
And people who believed what he believed
took his cause, and they made it their own,
and they told people.
And some of those people created structures
to get the word out to even more people.
And lo and behold,
250,000 people showed up
on the right day at the right time
to hear him speak.
How many of them showed up for him?
Zero.
They showed up for themselves.
It's what they believed about America
that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours
to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.
It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:
25 percent of the audience was white.
Dr. King believed that
there are two types of laws in this world:
those that are made by a higher authority
and those that are made by man.
And not until all the laws that are made by man
are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority
will we live in a just world.
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement
was the perfect thing to help him
bring his cause to life.
We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.
And, by the way, he gave the "I have a dream" speech,
not the "I have a plan" speech.

Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
They're not inspiring anybody.
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
Leaders hold a position of power
or authority,
but those who lead inspire us.
Whether they're individuals or organizations,
we follow those who lead,
not because we have to,
but because we want to.
We follow those who lead, not for them,
but for ourselves.
And it's those who start with "why"
that have the ability
to inspire those around them
or find others who inspire them.
Thank you very much.

When we park in a big parking lot,
how do we remember where we parked our car?
Here's the problem facing Homer.
And we're going to try to understand
what's happening in his brain.
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,
which is the organ of memory.
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"
which it resembles.
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.
So the human brain
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.
And the neurons communicate with each other
by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity
via connections to each other.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,
which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand
how spatial memory works
by recording from individual neurons
in rats or mice
while they forage or explore an environment
looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron
in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,
there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see
is that this neuron knows
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And it signals to the rest of the brain
by sending a little electrical spike.
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron
as a function of the animal's location.
And if we record from lots of different neurons,
we'll see that different neurons fire
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,
like in this square box shown here.
So together they form a map
for the rest of the brain,
telling the brain continually,
Where am I now within my environment?
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.
So epilepsy patients sometimes need
the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.
And some of these patients played a video game
where they drive around a small town.
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,
start sending electrical impulses
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.
So how does a place cell know
where the rat or person is within its environment?
Well these two cells here
show us that the boundaries of the environment
are particularly important.
So the one on the top
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls
of the box that their rat's in.
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.
The one below likes to fire
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.
And if you put another wall inside the box,
then the cell fires in both place
wherever there's a wall to the south
as the animal explores around in its box.
So this predicts
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --
extended buildings and so on --
is particularly important for the hippocampus.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,
cells are found which project into the hippocampus,
which do respond exactly
to detecting boundaries or edges
at particular distances and directions
from the rat or mouse
as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see,
it fires whenever the animal gets near
to a wall or a boundary to the east,
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box
or the circular wall of the circular box
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
And the cell on the right there
fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So that's one way in which we think
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
We can also test where we think objects are,
like this goal flag, in simple environments --
or indeed, where your car would be.
So we can have people explore an environment
and see the location they have to remember.
And then, if we put them back in the environment,
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down
where they thought that flag or their car was.
But on some trials,
we could change the shape and size of the environment
like we did with the place cell.
In that case, we can see
how where they think the flag had been changes
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.
And what you see, for example,
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,
and then if you ask people where it was,
but you've made the environment bigger,
where they think the flag had been
stretches out in exactly the same way
that the place cell firing stretched out.
It's as if you remember where the flag was
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells
at that location,
and then you can get back to that location
by moving around
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells
with that stored pattern.
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.
But we also know where we are through movement.
So if we take some outbound path --
perhaps we park and we wander off --
we know because our own movements,
which we can integrate over this path
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.
Now grid cells are found, again,
on the inputs to the hippocampus,
and they're a bit like place cells.
But now as the rat explores around,
each individual cell fires
in a whole array of different locations
which are laid out across the environment
in an amazingly regular triangular grid.
And if you record from several grid cells --
shown here in different colors --
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly
relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat
can put a virtual grid of firing locations
across its environment --
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,
but using triangles.
And as it moves around,
the electrical activity can pass
from one of these cells to the next cell
to keep track of where it is,
so that it can use its own movements
to know where it is in its environment.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns
have the same axes of symmetry,
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,
it means that the net activity
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain
should change
according to whether we're running along these six directions
or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner
and have them do a little video game
like the one I showed you
and look for this signal.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
So back to Homer.
He's probably remembering where his car was
in terms of the distances and directions
to extended buildings and boundaries
around the location where he parked.
And that would be represented
by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.
Now both of these kinds of cells
can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked
by moving so as to find where it is
that best matches the firing pattern
of the place cells in his brain currently
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location
irrespective of visual cues
like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
So beyond spatial memory,
if we look for this grid-like firing pattern
throughout the whole brain,
we see it in a whole series of locations
which are always active
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.
So it may be that the neural mechanisms
for representing the space around us
are also used for generating visual imagery
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.
So if this was happening,
your memories could start by place cells activating each other
via these dense interconnections
and then reactivating boundary cells
to create the spatial structure
of the scene around your viewpoint.
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.
Another kind of cell, head direction cells,
which I didn't mention yet,
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.
They could define the viewing direction
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.
So this is just one example
of a new era really
in cognitive neuroscience
where we're beginning to understand
psychological processes
like how you remember or imagine or even think
in terms of the actions
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.
Thank you very much.
